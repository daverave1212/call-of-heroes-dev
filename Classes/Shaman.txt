          Notes: For example, you can make a goblin run or recklessly attack one of your party members. But you can't make a guard jump off a cliff, because that's not what it would normally do.

            You can slightly peek outside of their body, and move your arms, upper body and head as if you were a ghost originating from that ally's body.
            o You can't move yourself, but you always move with that ally.
            o You can't do any physical actions (because you are basically a ghost and can't touch anything or anyone).
            o You can cast spells as normal. 
            o You follow your own Initiative in combat.
            o You can't take damage from external sources, but you feel every body sensation that ally feels.
