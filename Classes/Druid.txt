You gain that animal's Fortitude and Dexterity saves.
Apply any other modifiers (except for base Stats) from that animal.

Attacking while Shapeshifted has the same attack bonus, damage, weapon effect, etc as your normal attacking weapon.

You can't make attacks with ranged weapons while Shapeshifted, obviously.
While Shapeshifted, you can do any maneuvers you know. You can't cast spells.

If it has less, subtract the difference.
When Shapeshift ends, subtract back whatever health you added, or add back whatever health you subtracted.
When you end Shapeshift, if your health would be 0 or less, it stays at 1.
Shapeshift ends if you drop to 0 Health, and you go Unconscious.
You choose what items you keep on you when Shapeshifting, and those items are 'merged' into your new form.
At first, you can't choose innately swimming or flying animals.

- Coven of the Wild, where your true fey or animalistic nature takes shape!
- Coven of the Wicked, where nature-infused eldritch magic overcomes your mind, body and soul

Pagan Druids believe no one has the right to dictate someone else's spiritual path.
As a Pagan Druid, you oppose fanaticism, opressors and stupidity.
Pagan Druids worship no god, but they do acknowledge their power and they heavily respect nature and the earth.
A Pagan Druid gains the power through not black, nor white eldritch magic.
The suggested alignment for Pagan Druids is True Neutral.

//- Coven (not only ofr duirds, but yk witchcraft n shit)
//- Rely on components, scrying

You have the following abilities:

[Day Night Cycle] : Passive
Instead of knowing one set of spells, as normal, you know two: one for the moon, and one for the sun.
So, in total, you know twice as many spells.
The Moon spells can only be used at night (from end of dusk until start of dawn).
The Sun spells can only be used at day (from start of dawn until end of dusk).
The Sun spell set and the Moon spell set can not contain any of the same spell.
Whenever you learn a new spell, choose to put it either in the Sun spell set or the Moon spell set.
These Spell sets don't change.

[Moonfire/Sunfire] : 0.5 Actions
Spend 1 Charge.
A target within 6 meters makes a Wisdom save.
If it fails, it takes 1d8 + 1 Fire and is Crippled (if day) or Force damage and is Silenced (if night).
If you use this at night, you can't use it until day, and vice versa.


At Level 2, pick one of the following Talents and learn it permanently:

{Old Ritualist} : Special
You permanently lose the Shapeshift ability, and you can never choose Talents that improve Shapeshift.
Once per Long Rest, you can spend 10 minutes to perform an Old Ritual, which gives you 1 Charge.
The Old Ritual must be performed outdoors, in a safe, uncorrupted place untouched by regular folk.

{Lycanthropy} : Passive
At 24:00, on full moon nights, you transform into a ferocious beast, a Lycanthrope.

You also have Dark Vision.
Lycanthropy ends at the start of dawn.

{Animal Companion} : Passive
You have an animal pet that can fight alongside you!
Your animal has stats depending on its species.
By default, apply the following stats to your pet (these will get modified by your pet's species):
- Health: Half of yours

Your pet takes its turn at the same time as you do, and always has the same initiative as yours.
Your pet can make normal Skill Checks using your Skill bonuses, or its own, using its special Stats.
Your pet will not stray more than 30 meters away from you in hostile territory.
On your turn, you can command it to move, but it can't take its own Actions.
You and your pet share the same Actions on a turn.
(ex: If you have 1 Action, your pet can use 0.5 Actions to attack and you can use 0.5 Actions to attack too, or your pet spends 1 Action and you skip your Actions, etc.)
All pets have the Pet Attack ability:
	<Pet Attack> : 0.5 Actions
	The pet melee attacks a target.
	The attack deals 1d10 + Main Stat.
	You can do this once per turn.

#Spec#
Coven of the Wild
You are heavily in touch with nature and with strange creatures, uncommon to the normal folk.

You have the following ability:

[Wild Shape] : Passive
When you use Shapeshift, you can transform into a combination of 2 animals.
You take the highest stat from both animals, and you have access to both of their abilities.

At Level 2, pick one of the following Talents and learn it permanently:

{Forest Friends} : Passive
You have a Pixie companion, a very small humanoid with wings.
The Pixie has 20 Armor and always stays with you.

You can command the Pixie simple instructions for 0 Actions, like 'go there' or 'pick up that object'.
The Pixie Charisma, Wisdom and Intelligence equal to yours, but its Dexterity is 0 and its Strength is -10.

You can stay like that for up to 1 hour.

You benefit from Cover while inside a tree.

{Copy Cat} : Passive
You can now use Shapeshift to also transform into other people.
When you want to do this, roll a Deception check.
This check determines how close you get to the form of that person (20 or more means a perfect copy).
This copy just mimicks the body of the person, not the voice or personality or clothes.
Your Stats (Fortitude, Dexterity, etc) also change to that person's stats, but not your Health, Armor, Charges, etc.
Your Fortitude and Dexterity skill bonuses and Saves change to exactly equal to your new stats.
Your Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma skill bonuses and Saves stay the same as your normal ones.
This shapeshift ends if you take damage.
You can only copy a person once per day.
