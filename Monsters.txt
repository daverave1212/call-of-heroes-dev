	To get up you must activate all pressure plates.
	But be careful, because it shoots up fast, like a god damn gun!
Magnetic corridor. Have fun!

Dryad - cheese by exiting tree and going back

Black Dragon - guards fight him, they die, they get ressed as ghosts

??? - North-most enemies get X, south-most enemies Y
Mimick - 1 Hp, low AC, super high damage

	They have super high AC but very low Saves
Demons:
 - Naveshnee -> guy that makes pacts with commonfolk
 - Cat-demon -> tricks people into giving them things (can speak all languages)
