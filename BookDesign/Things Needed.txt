No:
- Black and white, old school look

- I want something that I can't do myself - it needs to look good and slightly original
- I need everything to be cohesive, not just copy elements from here and there and hope they work together
- Main color should be orange or purple?

- Border - I like the idea of a border around the page
  If we have a border, it should be minimalistic, like: Borders (Eldritch the book of madness).png
- Table Design
- Monster Stat block

- Page Background Texture (should be subtle and close to white, and work well with only white)
  In Numenera RPG, there's an image on the background but it's very subtle and with a paper texture.
  If you decide to have an image in the background, use a placeholder image.
  I want to have it close to white so I can fallback on the 'only white background' in case printing costs become too high
