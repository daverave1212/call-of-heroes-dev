Starting Abilities:

  ~Herbivore~ :
    A: Passive
    Effect: |
      You have +3 Reserve Health.
      You take 150% Damage from all Poison Damage (after Defense).
      Half of your meals can consist of grass and leaves, but you can not eat meat.

  ~Skipper~:
    A: Passive
    Effect: |
      You are immune to Slows.
      Also, you can freely jump up to 3 meters in length and/or height without rolling a Check (still uses 3 meters of your Movement).
    Notes: |
      If playing with grid, you can jump over 2 squares and land in the next one.
      You can jump over enemies, but you still become Fumbling if you exit their melee attack range.

Starting Abilities Description: |
  Bertles are natural herbivores, thus you are intolerant to meat, be it raw or cooked.
  If you are starving, however, you can eat meat to sate your hunger, but you will take Damage and feel sick for a period of time.

  Aside from that, Bertles are vulnerable to poisons.
  As an upside, Bertles have extra movement speed compared to other Races. That speed will be detrimental in combat!

      Effect: |
        You only take 50% Cold Damage (after Defense).
