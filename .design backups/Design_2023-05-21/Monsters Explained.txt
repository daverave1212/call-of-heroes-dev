Monsters Explained

# Encounter Balancing #
Every player is worth an amount of XP based on their level.
A Level 1 player is worth 100. Add 25 for every level after that.

Use the total XP worth of the party to create an encounter.
Add monsters to an encounter until the XP of the encounter reaches the player party total XP.
That is a Medium difficulty encounter.
