    Players might hear a rumor about a place in the forest where there are forbidden Fruit of Knowledge trees. 
    Eating such a fruit will grant a player Proficiency in any knowledge related Skill.
    The Dryads, though, forbid the players from eating them, because the fruits are their children (literally).
    Will they leave, fight the Dryads or sneakily steal the fruit (of course, the Dryads know they are trying to sneak and will ambush the Players).

    Some of them can cast water magic and take over control of summoned creatures.
    They can hold their breath long enough to stay on land a few hours at a time.
    They communicate through vibrations in the water, so their language might be inaudible in the open air.

    - Shallow or deep water
    - Net Traps
    - Corals and Shells (Caltrops)

Centaur:
  Type:         Humanoid

  Armor:        2
  Speed:        8
  Initiative:   9
  Abilities:
    - Ranged Weapon: 1d12 + 3
    - Melee Weapon:
        Damage: 8 (or 1d8 + 3)
        Onset: +1 Damage for each meter moved towards the target (strafing around the target does not count, it has to be straight movement towards it; diagonals are valid if you play on a grid).

  Passives:
    - Moving Target: If the Centaur moved this round, its Defense is doubled for the rest of the round.
    - Hooves: Immune to Caltrops and Difficult Terrain.
    - Jumpers: Can freely jump up to 2 meters high (while moving)
  Avoids AoE: No
  Behavior: |
    Moving towards the target, then switching direction, then moving towards it again only counts the meters AFTER switching direction as moving towards it.
    Centaur move as much as they possibly can to maximize their Onset Damage.
    If there is only one enemy around it, it will use Back Hooves. If it Dazes the target, it will move towards another target.
    If there are multiple enemies around it, will use Back Hooves and attack the other.
    Centaur strive when they are high on the Initiative track, as any attacks made against them before they take their turn deals more Damage (due to Moving Target).
    Snaring a Centaur is very effective.
  Pair: Pair with Wolves reskinned as Hyenas.
  Lore: |
    Centaurs live in glades, savannas and even mountain tops.
    They often settle near water and between hills to isolate their tribe from any potential danger.
    Centaurs are ferocious and brutal if you challenge them.
    They are also territorial and like to expand their territory through sheer violence.
    They are also stoic, loyal and can appear very noble if given the chance to talk to.

    Centaurs do the best when they are the ones attacking and ambushing.
  Valuable Loot:
    - Weapons
    - Small patches of leather armor
    - Leather Pelt* (20g) - low quality, but does the job

        Damage: 7 Pierce/Slash/Force (or 1d6 + 3)

  Avoids AoE: No
  Behavior: |
    Hippogriffs are smart enough to try to corner or push people off ledges with their attacks.
    They will fly even to the back line to try to push them off a cliff or into a corner.
    Hippogriffs like to ambush prey especially when it's raining or during a thunderstorm, as the rain camouflages their presence.
  Lore: |
    Hippogriffs are notoriously agressive and almost exclusively carnivorous.
    To find prey, a Hippogriff will circle in the sky around an area until it finds something suitable for eating.
    Hippogriffs often migrate long distances to find a mate, as they avoid interbreeding.
    It might not be that uncommon to see a flying hippogriff in the sky during the day.
    Hippogriffs adapt very quickly to new environments. Thus you might find a hippogriff in a forest, on a snow covered mountain, on an island beach hunting for fish, etc.
  Suggested Obstacles:
    - Heavy Wind
    - Thunderstorms (lightning might strike someone)
    - Crevices and Cliffs
    - Pits
    - Ruin walls, or lots of larger wall-like debris

            This counts as a Melee Attack and ignores Cover.

    Griphons are majestic creature with the front body and wings of an eagle, and rear body of a lion.
    Often, Griphons represent royalty and are among the more expensive mounts and pets, though they can be Trained and are very loyal once domesticated.
    Griphons are said to be the kings of the skies and they are apex predators of the wilds.
    Riding a Griphon is a privilege - very few get the chance to do it. Being allowed to ride it is a sign of utmost respect from the Griphon.

        Drag and Stick: |
            Target must pass a 12 Dexterity Check or the Mimic drags itself to it and sticks to it with its tongue.

    Mimics are monsters that take the shape of common objects made of metal, wood or any household texture.
    They can camouflage into any object it has seen that matches its volume.
    Mimics come in all shapes and sizes. There could be a mimic the size of a bed morphed into a bed.
    Mimics can also shapeshift into living creatures, albeit the form is rather crude and they can't move (the Mimic must remain still to maintain form).
    Be creative with what the Mimic transforms into in order to ambush the Players!

    If the players go into their cellar, they will find a dungeon with a Gibbering Mouther and a mad scientist living there.

    They won't expect either of these scenarios!

    Hit as many Units as possible (even allies) with Death Cloud.
    Avoid repeat-casting Finger of Death on the same Unit - hold it for other Units. Note that it's a Reaction, and can't be used on the Lich's own turn.
    Pair with a Flying Weapon, a Gasha, Bat Swarms, Zombies and Cultists.
    Avoid pairing with normal Skeletons to prevent confusion.

  Abilities:
    - Scratch (x3): 1d4 + 3 Slash
  Passives:
    - Sandstorm: |
        When Sandman is revealed (or whenever it wants), it creates a 4x4 sand storm at its location (free Action).
        The sand storm is difficult terrain.
        Attacks in, out and through the sand storm have Cover.
        A storm can be dissipated with large wind/force gusts or other creative means.

    - Partial Invisibility (Non-Combat): Invisible out of combat. Revealed when a different creature gets close (1 meter).        
    - Steal Sleep (Non-Combat): |
        If a Sandman is nearby (5 meters) when someone is sleeping, their sleep becomes low quality sleep.

  Lore: |
    Sandmen are small, yet powerful fiends that steal quality sleep.
    While someone is sleeping, the Sandman can feed on its sleep.
    This does not wake up their victims or reveal the Sandman.
    This also often results in sleep paralysis, nightmares or waking up more tired than before.

        The Damage to the scarecrow does not affect the HP of the Bubak.
    - Body Swap (Non-Combat): While the Bubak is dormant, it can choose to instantly swap the scarecrow it is possessing to another one within 15 meters. It can do this at any point while dormant. If there is no scarecrow to swap to, the Bubak dies.

        When someone comes within 3 meters of the Bubak, it becomes Active.
        It teleports near the target (up to 3 meters) and the targets are Ambushed.
        All other Bubaks in the area do the same.
    - Consume Body: The Bubak can consume a dead body to fuel itself. The body disappears.
  Avoids AoE: No
  Behavior: |
    Bubaks live inside scarecrows.
    They do not become active even when attacked from a distance.
    If the players would destroy from a distance a scarecrow where the Bubak is, the Bubak just swaps body to another nearby scarecrow.
    It immediately attacks as soon as someone gets close enough or if there is no other scarecrow to swap to.
  Pair: Pair with Raven Swarms (Bat Swarm).
  Lore: |
    A Bubak is a spirit that inhabits scarecrows.
    When dormant, it is impossible to detect a Bubak inside a scarecrow (except through magical means).
    When active, the Bubak has the body of a scarecrow but is covered in an ominous aura of any color that inspires evil or fear.

    A Singularity is a strange, sentient phenomenon whose only purpose is to destroy, for unknown reasons.
    It appears to have glimpses of extreme intelligence, and glimpses of very low (e.g. one time it might choose to position itself to hit well with Gravitate, other times not).

# Non-Combat Monsters
Domovoy:
  Type:         Fey
  Degree:       Non-Combat
  Experience:   100
  Stats:        1/1/2/3/-2
  Health:       30
  Armor:        1
  Speed:        5
  Initiative:   0
  Abilities:
    - Be Creative: Anything goes.
  Passives:
    Invisible: Invisible and inaudible.
  Avoids AoE: No
  Behavior: |
    Hides most of the time and makes no sound.
    Only acts when alone and out of sight.
  Lore: |
    Domovoy is an invisible, inaudible and shy house spirit (Kikimora is his wife, or the female version of Domovoy).
    A Domovoy will randomly choose a house that looks comfortable and will assume it as its home.
    Once the Domovoy is at home, he will help around the house with cleaning, keeping away pests, rearranging furniture, etc. Domovoy are usually the embodiment of obsessive compulsive disorder.
    The Domovoy will expect payment in return in the form of food and drink and occasionally entertainment (toys, books, etc).
    If the house members do not respect and pay the Domovoy, he will do the opposite - make messes, haunt and cause havoc.
    
    Domovoy are very shy beings and they will almost never act in plain sight. They always do their work and eating while no one is around. Thus, it always appears like objects just arranged themselves when no one was looking.
    If the house is big enough and the house members are friendly, the Domovoy might attract even more of his kind to raise a family at this house.
    
    A lot of the time, house members befriend the Domovoy and treat him as part of their family. Although, sometimes the Domovoy might get invasive and only like things his own way, such as arranging objects in a certain type of way the house members might not like.
    The Domovoy 
    
    Although invisible, the Domovody does have a true, visible form as a small, blue (or gray or green) man.
    House members usually never get to see the Domovoy's true form.
    Seeing the true form of a Domovoy is something reserved only for those who have the Domovoy's utmost respect.
    
    It can be hard to communicate with a Domovoy, as they can't speak and won't do anything in plain sight when asked directly.
  Suggested Obstacles:
    None
  Monster Data: No tactic, mid HP, no gimmick
  Role: Non-Combat
  Variants: Kikimora, Yaramayhawho
  Story Ideas: |
    A quest panel states that the Domovoy of a house is distressed and nobody knows why.
    The Domovody will not answer if asked anything directly, or if asked to show himself.
    The players must find a creative way to communicate with the Domovoy to figure out what's distressing him.
    It could be a group of monsters nearby the Domovoy is afraid of.
    The players might give up if they see no sign of the Domovoy, and that's ok. That is the feeling the Domovoy transmits: shy, and hard to know they truly exist if you don't live inside the house.

Satyr:
  Type:         Fiend
  Degree:       Non-Combat
  Experience:   200

  Health:       43
  Armor:        3
  Speed:        6
  Initiative:   15
  Abilities:
    - Be Creative: Anything goes.
  # Abilities:
  #   - High Note: 2d8 Psychic to all units that can hear him (against Defense)
  #   - Melee Weapon: 1d8 + 3
  #   - Curse of Laughter (6m range): |
  #       A target rolls a 12 Grade Sense Check.
  #       If it fails, it starts laughing uncontrolably and is Paralyzed.
  #   - Blessing of Joy: |
  #       The Satyr sings a song.
  #       All units listening gain +1 Speed for one week and are healed for up to 10 HP.
  #       Usable once per day.
  # Passives:
  #   - Psychoactive Drinks: |
  #       The Satyr carries a jug of magical psychoactive wine.
  #       Soon after drank, this distorts space and time for the drinker, creates vivid hallucinations and induces euphoria.
  #       The Satyr can use this as a distraction to steal from the players.
    - Immunities: Immune to Sleep, Charm and Fear.
  Avoids AoE: Yes
  Behavior: |
    A Satyr will stalk the Players for a while, then they meet them pretending it's all a coincidence.
    The Satyr might offer a bargain: players give him something interesting and new and he blesses them.
    If the Satyr is dissatisfied with the offer, he will try to drug the players and take whatever he believes is valuable from them.
    Pretend the Psychoactive Drink is what blesses the players.
    
    To narrate the hallucinations, just pretend the day (or night) goes on normally and something very strange happens - like a dragon appearing and talking to them about life, or getting attacked by ducks.
    
    If only one player chooses to ignore the drinks, the Satyr will try to use Curse of Laughter on them when the effects start taking place in the other party members.
    It then proceeds to steal...
    
    If a combat ensues, pair with...
  Lore: None
  Suggested Obstacles:

  Monster Data: No tactic, mid HP, no gimmick
  Role: Other
  Variants: None
  Story Ideas: |
    A Satyr might just show up at the players' camp at night and ask for a party or a drink. Try to introduce him when the Players actually need healing.
    The Psychoactive Drinks might produce a lot of chaos if used at a public event on everyone! Find a creative way to make that fun!

Milonitse:
  Type:         Humanoid, Fiend
  Degree:       Non-Combat
  Experience:   400
  Stats:        0/0/5/5/0
  Health:       60
  Armor:        5
  Speed:        5
  Initiative:   14
  Abilities:
    - Disease Target: A target must pass a 12 Might Check or be afflicted with a common disease of choice (Black Plague, Influenza, Pox, etc). While Diseased, it can not regain Health and suffers of Exhaustion until the disease is cured (usually 2 to 3 weeks).
  Passives:
    - Plaguebringers: |
        After channeling for one hour, a plague appears in the town to target random individuals (about 5% of the population). The disease might take days or weeks to show symptoms.
        After bringing the plague, the Milonitse disappear into nothingness, their duty having been fulfilled.
    - Dissipate: Milonitse can freely disappear at will. They reappear at any chosen point within 1 kilometer.
  Avoids AoE: Yes
  Behavior: |
    Negotiate with the players about bringing the plague.
    Milonitse know no rest until their duty has been fulfilled - to bring disease.
    Their sole goal is to bring plagues and disease to the masses.
    
    However, Milonitse can be convinced to spare a village. Under no circumstances can they be convinced through sheer talking.
    Milonitse can be averted by giving them a gift, negotiating for something of roughly the same value or by redirecting them to a different village.
    
    If nothing succeeds, the plague can be stopped from inside the village by identifying sick individuals and quarantining them before it's too late, or finding a remedy.
    
    If Milonitse are attacked, they instantly Dissipate.
  Lore: |
    Milonitse are spirit women that march in groups and bring plagues.
    They resemble nuns or religious women on a pilgrimage, though they can look like doctors, druids or even just commonfolk dressed in traditional Slavic country-side clothes.
    They can be encountered anywhere in the proximity of a village, marching on towards the village.
    On arrival, they will cast a ritual to bring plagues to the village, then they will dissipate.
  Suggested Obstacles: None
  Monster Data: No tactic, mid HP, no gimmick
  Role: Main Enemy
  Variants: None
  Story Ideas: |
    Players can encounter them on the road, or at a campfire at night.
    Make the atmosphere dark and silent, to fit with the theme of Milonitse.
