  ~Animal Companion~:  # 3
    AlignOnWebsite: Left
    A: Passive
    Effect: |
      You have an animal pet that can fight alongside you!
      Your animal has stats depending on its species. Check out the Pets and Animals page to see its stats!
      Your pet takes its turn at the same time as you do, and always has the same initiative as yours.
      Your pet has 1 Action per turn, which it can use to do its own Abilities or Pet Attack.
      Your pet can make normal Checks using using its own Stats.
      Your pet will not stray more than 30 meters away from you in hostile territory.
    Upgrade: If your pet drops to 0 Health, it becomes Fallen, like a player. It has no reserve Health, but at any point outside of combat, you (the pet owner) can spend 30 minutes to tend to your pet's wounds and heal it back to full Health.
    Notes: |
      If your pet raises from being Fallen, it has Pet Exhaustion (is Slowed and deals -2 Damage from all sources).
      Treat your pet like a real companion - give it a name and care for it. If it ever dies, you can spend 2 days looking for another wild animal and taming it to become your new pet.
      If your pet ever dies, you can spend 8 hours inbetween Adventures to get a new pet. If you want to change your Pet and abandon your current one, you can do so inbetween Adventures, but the guilt will make you Fumbling for the next 2 Worthy Combat encounters.
      
  ~Pet Attack~:
      A: 1 Action (from the pet)
      Effect: |
          The pet melee attacks a target.

        ~Stablemaster~:   # 1
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            You have 3 different Animal Companion pets, but only one can adventure with you at a time.
            While not with you, your other Animal Companions hang out on their own in the wilderness, but no more than 5 kilometers away from you.
            You can send your current companion off, then spend 30 minutes to telepathically call another one to come join you.
          Notes: |
            The advantage is you can use several animal Abilities that have longer Cooldowns; these are usually stronger.
            It is possible that the animal you're calling can't come to your aid if you're indoors, flying or the trail you're on is too difficult. In that case, you will have to return outside or on a safe trail (GM's decision).
            In that case, your current companion can not go away, either.

            This Animal Companion obeys the same rules as the regular one (takes its turns, requires healing between combats, etc).
            One of your 3 Animal Companions can be an Exotic Animal.
          Notes: You're instantly kicked from the group if your pets don't have names.

            One of your 3 Animal Companions grows to become Large. Its maximum Health increases by 50% and its attack range by 1.

            One pet makes a melee Attack for 3d6 + 4 Slash Damage.
            If the target is at or below 50% Health, deal 2d6 extra Damage and the target halves all healing it receives for the rest of the encounter.
          Notes: This takes 1 Action from YOU, not your pet.

            Your pet(s) within 5 meters of its landing place can dash to it (after it lands) and make a total of 3 Pet Attacks on it.
          Notes: |
            Goes flying means is pushed, knocked up, dragged, etc.
            This uses YOUR Reaction, not your pets'.
            Obviously, the pets need line of sight and can't jump through walls, or over large obstacles. Apply common sense.
