Other: |
  If a Unit gets Crowd Controlled while doing an Ability (e.g. "move, then attack"), what happens depends on the Crowd Control type:
  - Pushing, Knock Prone: everything in the Ability that would follow the movement gets cancelled
  - Cripple, Daze, Slow: Nothing happens on the spot; the Crowd Control takes effect after the Ability finishes
  - Silence: If it's a Spell, the rest of the Spell gets cancelled; otherwise nothing else happens
  - Stun and other non-listed strong CC: The Ability gets cancelled
  - Blind: Apply the Hard Cover normally
  - Fear, Charm: The Unit must retract its action if it was on the Fearer/Charmer; then, it must move. Then, it can resume its turn and it use that same Action or another one as it pleases, now or later in the turn (the Unit does not lose its Action).
