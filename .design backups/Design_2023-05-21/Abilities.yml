    # How to make an ability
# For standard spells, apply the calculations defined in the Tables.xlsx file
# For single target spells that cost Mana, feel free to round numbers up
# Every 4 levels, you can slightly increase the Damage of a Spell or give it an extra effect

    # Never make the following abilities:
# Zone of Truth (its against the roleplay design)
# Nondetection (it's an anti-DM spell that doesnt bring anything of value)

# ToDo:
# Make some good spells that Artificer - Spellcraft can benefit from (e.g. CC, small area, short range, even amount of dice)
# Make some good spells against specific enemies (giants, undead, elementals)

          If you did this, when your turn ends, you are no longer Hidden.
        Notes: |
          Attacking or using Abilities or moving out of cover in relation to any enemy makes you unhides you.

            You can also freely move it up to 3 meters every turn.
        Notes: |
            It costs 1 Action and 1 Mana to summon the weapon. Then, the weapon can attack once for free every turn, without costing an Action or Mana.
            The weapon has no special effect and can't be targeted by attacks.
            The weapon disappears if it moves more than 20 meters away from you.

        A: 1 Action
        Cost: 1 Mana
        Range: 5 meters
        Effect: |

        Notes: |

        Effect: |

            All Units in that zone make a Dexterity Check with Disadvantage.
            If they fail, they become outlined in a colored glow (you choose the color).
            Those Units can't benefit from regular Cover, and Hard Cover only provides them with normal Cover.
            The Units glow even through walls, but the denser the walls, the less they appear to glow.
        Notes: |
            A 1-meter thick concrete wall completely blocks the glow.

            You can move the hand as you move your normal hands and you can move your hand by spending meters from your remaining Movement.
            The hand can't attack and disappears if it goes outside a 10 meters range.

            If cast like this, the Mage Hand has 15 Health and 0 Defense, and the effect ends if it is destroyed.
        Notes: |
            The hand can't lift objects weighing more than 10kg.
            Moving the hand spends Actions as if you made moved your own hand.

            You create an illusion that fits at most in a 2x2x2 meter cube.
            The illusion appears real to the eyes, ears and by smell, but physical interaction makes it obvious it's an illusion and objects pass through it normally.
            The illusion can deal no Damage or Crowd Control, but can provide Cover or block Line of Sight (both from the front, and from behind).
            On your turn, you can and must spend 1 Action to keep and/or move the illusion, otherwise it is dispelled.
            You can only have 1 illusion active at a time.
        Upgrade: |
            At Level 7, the illusion lasts indefinitely until you cancel it without needing to spend Actions, and it can hold its own simple movement and clockwork-like routines.
