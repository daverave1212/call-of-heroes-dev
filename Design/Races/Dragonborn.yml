Race: Dragonborn
Variant: Loxen
Description: |
  As you venture forward, a scorching trail sears its mark upon the grass, leaving a path of charred vegetation in its wake. Your attention is drawn to a pair of piercing yellow eyes that meet yours, and in that instant, the enigmatic nature of the Dragonborn becomes clear. 
  The Dragonborn, embodying the essence of their draconic lineage, come in a kaleidoscope of colors that mirror their affinity to elemental forces. From the fiery red scales symbolizing a connection to flames, to the electric hues representing a mastery over lightning, each Dragonborn bears a unique chromatic expression of their power. Some may display majestic wings, capable of carrying them through the skies with grace, while others brandish horns and tails that serve as physical manifestations of their draconic heritage.
  Speaking a language known as Draconic, a complex tongue of breaths and resonating shouts, the Dragonborn wield a formidable ability to harness the elemental forces within them. Through their breath, they can unleash torrents of flame, bolts of lightning, icy gusts, or other elemental manifestations, harnessing and mastering their power to devastating effect. Born from eggs rather than nurtured within mammals, the Dragonborn possess a profound connection to the cycles of life and rebirth, their hatching representing the emergence of ancient wisdom and raw potential.
