Starting Abilities:

  ~Meditation~:
    A: Passive
    Effect: |
      As an Elf, your sleep is more akin to meditation and you only need 4 hours of sleep per night.
      Elves don't dream and can still hear and smell while sleeping, but at a lower responsiveness.

  ~The Blade Dance~ :
    A: Passive
    Effect: When you land the killing strike on a Worthy Enemy, you reset your movement this turn and don't provoke attacks of oportunity this turn (and you can continue your Movement).

  ~Arcane Veins~ :
      A: Passive
      Effect: |
        You have access to the Arcane Spell School, no matter what class you are.

Starting Abilities Description: |
    Elves are naturally swift and gracious, thus being able to make extra agile steps during battle.
    A Worthy Enemy is a normal Enemy Unit in a Combat Encounter.
    Enemies defeated in "quick combat" do not count as Worthy, and Minion Units are not Worthy.
    Also, defenseless units do not count as Worthy.

Talents:
  
    ~Lithe~ :
      A: Passive
      Effect: While below 50% Health, you are immune to Fumbling and you can Break your Movement into as many parts as you want.
      Notes: |
        Fumbling is when you move away from an enemy's melee attack range; if you are Fumbling, all your actions have Cover.
        Breaking your Movement means you can Move, do an Action, then continue your Movement.

      Notes: This can't be changed, so choose wisely!

    ~Agile Technique~:
      A: Passive
      Effect: You can use any weapon with your Dexterity Stat (instead of Might, in some cases).
