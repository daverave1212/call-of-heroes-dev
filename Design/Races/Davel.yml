Race: Davel
Description: |
    A strange person greets you - horns, hooves and a long swirly tail. Commonfolk might feel in danger, but you know better, for judging a Davel's personality is as easy as looking for clear physical traits. This one's horns form a halo, and its eyes are a glowing white not for magic nor disease, but due to its devotion to the light.
    Davels are generally demon people, but the ancestries of some can be traced back even to fallen angels, faeries, underground demons, or unspeakable realms. Demonic as they might be, Davels are not necessarily evil, but their looks shift according to their beliefs and what drives them in life. A warrior Davel might have his horns turn ram-like, and have his nose flatten to look more like a bull, with a shorter, bulkier tail. Similarly, a depressed Davel's hair might turn gray and straight, and horns might start pointing downward, while a druid Davel's horns might start to resemble the horns of a stag, with their tails' ends resembling a leaf. Their lifespan also depends on their beliefs and morals; a Davel driven by meditation and peace will live considerably longer, while a Davel dark mage's lifespan will be significantly shorter.
    Society is driven by lies and deception, and while Davels know that, it poses a challenge for Davels to lie. But make no mistake - the best lie is avoiding the truth.

        Notes: |
            This is useful when consuming potions in combat, or when you need to quickly apply the effect of a potion.
            This counts as if you consumed the potion when you use the 0 Actions, or when the 8 hours expire (e.g. for overdose).
