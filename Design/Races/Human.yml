Race: Human
Description: |
  What motivates you? Is it power? Money? Respect? Or perhaps an insatiable craving for more, an unquenchable thirst that drives you relentlessly forward? Your race has built towering empires, conquered nations, and endured catastrophic collapses. Humans, embodying the duality of their nature, have proven themselves to be both the paragons of leadership and the epitomes of tyranny.
  For every human, there exists an inherent aspiration for more. They yearn to leave the familiar confines of their towns and embark on grand adventures, driven by a potent mixture of thrill-seeking and the allure of promised rewards. No mountain stands too tall, no ocean runs too deep, and no desert presents an insurmountable challenge to these innate explorers. Humans possess an innate ability to multitask, deftly juggling myriad responsibilities, and they possess a sharp acumen for swiftly and efficiently solving problems.
  The origin of the humans remains shrouded in mystery. Among the younger races, they burst forth seemingly out of nowhere, establishing themselves as a force to be reckoned with. Humans make formidable allies when befriended, their adaptability and resourcefulness shining through. However, one must exercise caution, for their unpredictable nature can transform them into formidable adversaries when antagonized. The humans, a complex and ever-evolving race, carry within them the potential for greatness or darkness, and their story continues to unfold across the realms, leaving an indelible mark wherever they tread.

Starting Abilities Description:
    - Humans: |
        Humans are among the most consistent of the races and their concentration and mental resilience make them able to constantly succeed at menial tasks.
        Human Vigilence also works for Resist Checks. But use it carefully - if you don't match the Spell Grade, you will fail automatically if you choose to take 4 instead of rolling!

        There are several interesting starting Abilities you can choose from as a Human.
        You can make yourself immune to Slows through the Bertle Ability, get more Reserve Health from Dwarves, a Spell from Elves.
        You could see in the dark like the Gnomes, detect living Units like the Hollows or use Might instead of Dexterity with any weapon!
