Starting Abilities Description:
    - Humans: |
        Humans are among the most consistent of the races and their concentration and mental resilience make them able to constantly succeed at menial tasks.
        Human Vigilence also works for Combat Checks. But use it carefully - if you don't match the Counter Check Grade, you will fail automatically if you choose to take 4 instead of rolling!
    - Human Diversity: |
        There are several interesting starting Abilities you can choose from as a Human.
        You can make yourself immune to Slows through the Bertle Ability, get more Reserve Health from Dwarves, a Spell from Elves.
        You could see in the dark like the Gnomes, detect living creatures like the Hollows or use Might instead of Dexterity with any weapon!
    - Talented: |
        Humans don't start with training in any specific weapons, but rather with Training in any 2 Weapon Categories (e.g. 1-Handed Melee, 2-Handed Melee, 2-Handed Ranged, etc).
        Check the Weapons page to see all the weapon categories!
