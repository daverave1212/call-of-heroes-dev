Race: Hollow
Description: |
  A stranger knocks on your door in the middle of the night, and as you open it, you're confronted with a chilling sight. Before you stands a monstrosity, its flesh half torn and mangled. Yet, despite the grotesque appearance, its eyes carry a glimmer of familiarity. You would recognize those eyes anywhere — your old friend, killed in the great war, has returned from the dead.
  Hollows are revenants, restless souls of individuals who suffered an unworthy or untimely death and were inexplicably brought back to life. Confused and unaware of the circumstances surrounding their resurrection, they carry an immense burden—a task left unfinished in their mortal existence. Most Hollows find themselves detached from emotions, their essence drained and replaced with a void. However, a flicker of their former selves remains, often connected to one or two emotions that they feel deeply. Some may carry love and grief from their past lives, while others are fueled by anger and the desire for revenge.
  The existence of a Hollow is often plagued by partial amnesia, leaving them with fragmented memories of their previous lives. They might struggle to recall even their own names, forcing them to adopt new identities based on their present emotions or the goals they aim to accomplish. However, once they fulfill their purpose, a Hollow experiences a profound sense of completion, and unless another compelling goal arises, they embrace their final rest.
