Starting Abilities:

  ~Inherited Tastes~ :
    A: Passive
    Effect: |
      As a Gnome, you don't age from the passing of time. Instead, you age more rapidly when you are suffering emotionally (about 10 times faster than a human, in periods when you're depressed, anxious, fearful, etc).
      You don't have a sense of taste, but your eyes perceive colors sharper than other races.
      Gnomes' daydreams tend to be very vivid, almost as vivid as regular dreams at night or akin to hallucinations.

  ~Lucky Presence~ :
    A: Reaction
    Cooldown: Once / Adventure
    Effect: After another Unit you can see of you makes a roll, you can force them to reroll one die once and keep the new result.
    Upgrade: At Level 4, you can use this twice per Adventure.

  ~Quick to Act~:
    A: Passive
    Effect: |
      You have +4 Initiative.

Starting Abilities Description:
    - Taste: |
        Depending on your type of ancestry, you might not have a sense of taste (see Oh, My Tongue!).
        However, Gnomes see a larger spectrum of colors compared to other races.
        In roleplaying situations, this could translate into being able to see hidden messages written in "invisible" colors, detecting certain types of magic that emmanate invisible light, etc.
        Ask your DM if you see any of those; you might find something!
    - Lucky Presence: |
        Gnomes inspire a slight aura of luck to their friends and foes alike!
        With Lucky Presence, you can alter the results of die rolls for your allies or even enemies.
        As a Gnome, you don't make yourself magically reroll dice, but rather your environment (note that you can't reroll your own dice with Lucky Presence).

Talents:

    ~Catch Me If You Can~ :
      A: 0 Actions
      Cooldown: Once / Adventure
      Effect: |

        Also, passively, your Movement Speed increases by 1 meter.

    ~Oh, My Tongue!~ :
      A: Passive
      Effect: |
        You now have a sense of taste. Congratulations!
        You can detect whether something is poisonous by licking it without being affected by that poison.
        You have 50% resistance to Acid and Poison.
