Starting Abilities Description:
    - Dwarf Resting: |
        Dwarves are slow folk - they need a lot of rest to be able to do their tasks.
        However, that does not mean they are lazy; quite the contrary. Dwarves make very good use of their limited time.
        Some Dwarves choose to sleep in multiple shifts instead of a single 12 hour sleep shift.
        While awake, Dwarves are very sturdy; hence their increased Health, Dwarven Resilience and not having their speed reduced by Armor or Slows.
    - Dwarven Resilience: |
        Combat Checks are special types of Checks that happen from Abilities (of enemies, for example).
        These Combat Checks are not usually optional. For example, an enemy might make you make a Dexterity Combat Check to dodge an attack,
        If you fail it, you can just choose to do the roll again.
        Then you must wait until you do a Long Rest to be able to do this again.
