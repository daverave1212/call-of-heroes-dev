Starting Abilities Description:
    - Dwarf Resting: |
        Dwarves are slow folk - they usually need a lot of rest to be able to do their tasks.
        However, that does not mean they are lazy; quite the contrary. Dwarves make very good use of their limited time.
        On vacations, Dwarves ocasionally hibernate for longer periods.
        While awake, Dwarves are very sturdy; hence their increased Health, Dwarven Resilience and not having their speed reduced by Armor or Slows.
    - Dwarven Resilience: |
        Combat Checks are special types of Checks that happen from enemy Abilities.
        These Combat Checks are not usually optional. For example, an enemy could make you make a Dexterity Combat Check to dodge an attack.
        If you fail it, you can just choose to do the roll again.
        Then you must wait until you do a Long Rest to be able to do this again.

    ~Stone-Like Bones~:
      A: Passive
      Effect: |
        Your bones are tough as rock.

      Notes: |
        You can't change these Spells on a Long Rest, so choose wisely.
        You must still respect the Level requirement for these Spells, if any.
