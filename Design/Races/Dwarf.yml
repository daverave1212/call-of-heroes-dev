Starting Abilities Description:
    - Dwarf Resting: |
        Dwarves are slow folk - they need a lot of rest to be able to do their tasks.
        However, that does not mean they are lazy; quite the contrary. Dwarves make very good use of their limited time.
        Some Dwarves choose to sleep in multiple shifts instead of a single 12 hour sleep shift.
        While awake, Dwarves are very sturdy; hence their increased Health, Dwarven Resilience and not having their speed reduced by Armor or Slows.
    - Dwarven Resilience: |
        Combat Checks are special types of Checks that happen from Abilities (of enemies, for example).
        These Combat Checks are not usually optional. For example, an enemy might make you make a Dexterity Combat Check to dodge an attack,
        If you fail it, you can just choose to do the roll again.
        Then you must wait until you do a Long Rest to be able to do this again.

    ~Stone-Like Bones~:
      A: Passive
      Effect: |
        Your bones are tough as rock.
        You only take 50% damage from falling and from traps that deal physical damage.
        Your Reserve Health pool increases by 5.

    ~Runesmith~:
      A: Passive
      Effect: |
        You permanently know 2 Generic Abilities from the Arcane or Conjuration spell lists.
        You gain Proficiency in Arcana (see Backgrounds).
      Notes: If your Class is not Mana-based, you can't cast Spells that cost Mana. These Spells are permanent and can't be changed on Long Rests, so choose wisely!
