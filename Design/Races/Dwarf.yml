Race: Dwarf
Description: |
  "Ah, I see the fire in yer eyes, eager to hear the tales of old," the weathered Dwarf says, beckoning you to join him by the crackling flames. "Well, settle in, lad, for I shall regale ye with the legend of our people, an ancient race that has borne witness to the unfolding of history itself."
  The Dwarves, known for their stocky frames and unyielding determination, stand as stalwart guardians of tradition and craftsmanship. Standing no taller than one and a half meters, they possess a stoutness that belies their extraordinary resilience. Their long lifespans grant them the gift of time, enabling them to witness the ebb and flow of civilizations, and accumulate wisdom that spans centuries. Though Dwarves may appear slow and in need of ample rest, their diligent nature sets them apart. Far from being idle, they channel their limited energy with unwavering focus, ensuring that every waking moment is utilized for productivity and progress. They may take frequent breaks and even hibernate during extended vacations, recharging their spirits and bodies for the challenges that lie ahead. It is in this balance of toil and respite that the Dwarves find the strength to create magnificent works of craftsmanship, shaping the very foundations of their society.
  A part of the Dwarves carve their homes deep beneath the earth, where they forge magnificent subterranean cities. However, their spirit knows no boundaries, as some Dwarves embrace the rugged northern lands by the treacherous ocean, honing their boatbuilding skills. Others find solace amidst lush forests, forming a profound connection with nature, where their craftsmanship seamlessly intertwines with the beauty of the natural world.

Starting Abilities Description:
    - Dwarf Resting: |
        Dwarves are slow folk - they usually need a lot of rest to be able to do their tasks.
        However, that does not mean they are lazy; quite the contrary. Dwarves make very good use of their limited time.
        On vacations, Dwarves ocasionally hibernate for longer periods.
        While awake, Dwarves are very sturdy; hence their increased Health, Dwarven Resilience and not having their speed reduced by Armor or Slows.
