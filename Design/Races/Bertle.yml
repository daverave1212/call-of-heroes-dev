Race: Bertle
Description: |
  Peering from behind a towering tree, a whimsical creature captures your attention with its keen eyes. Its fluffy form, resembling a bipedal rabbit, fox, raccoon, or other enchanting woodland creature, emanates an aura of curiosity and grace.
  Bertles possess a gentle and herbivorous nature, thriving on a vegetarian diet. While their love for greens is unmatched, it is their remarkable agility that truly sets them apart, as they excel in evading danger and traversing treacherous terrains with ease. This makes them excellent adventurers who leave thier homes in search of great wonders and stories to tell when they return!
  Bertles are known for their tribal societies, where they forge strong bonds within their communities. Living harmoniously amidst lush woodlands and enchanting meadows, these tribes prioritize unity and cooperation. Standing at heights ranging from 1 meter to 2 meters, depending on the species, Bertles showcase an array of vibrant hair and eye colorations, adding to the diversity of their appearances. They, however, are not afraid to fight! They may not hunt for food, but some might have retractible claws or sharp fangs, making them great exceptional monster hunters!
