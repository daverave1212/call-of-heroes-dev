Race: Orc
Description: |
  Tribal in nature, though not stupid.
  Orc societies are highly based on honor and strength.
  Many orcs are also in tune with nature or spirits, allowing them to be both powerful and cunning.
  Unlike orcs in traditional fantasy, Orcs in Call of Heroes are not necessarily vile and reckless.
  Orcs are leaders and hunters by nature, but will also be lead by someone stronger or who can indeed lead better than them.
  Even in a more peaceful tribe, the most charismatic, witty and strong orc will be the leader.
  Orcs are also driven by control (over territory, goods, etc).
  Many of them wish to be in control - they don't like other people doing things for them, unless they are sure they can do it better.
  For this reason, many orcs make a living without help.
  They build their own houses, hunt their own food or pillage for both the good of the tribe and their own.

Starting Abilities:

  ~Boiling Blood~ :
    A: 0 Actions
    Cost: Half of your current Health
    Cooldown: Long Rest
    Effect: |
      Use after you make a damage roll.
      Increase the dice Damage of it by 50%.
    Notes: |
      Extra Abilities over an attack are not increased (e.g. Smite), because they are an extra damage roll. Only increase the total numbers on the dice by 50%, rounded down, without bonuses.
      Note that some Abilities have multiple rolls, like Magic Missile, Slam, etc.

  ~Battle Anguish~ :
    A: Passive
    Effect: |
        You do not suffer Exhaustion penalties when you are healed and raise from being Fallen in combat.
        However, after the first time you fall in combat, you can no longer use Abilities that Heal or cost 0 Actions (for the rest of this combat).

Starting Abilities Description:
    - Boiling Blood: |
        The lower your current Health is, the more efficient Boiling Blood is, because the less Health you spend (which needs to be healed later).
        Remember that numbers are rounded down. If you have 1 Health, you lose no Health!
        It's all about the timing!
    - Battle Anguish: |
        Orcs' falling in combat is different from other races'. You can be healed as many times as you can when you fall in combat.
        They suffer another downside to this, though: after you Fall once in combat, you can no longer Heal anyone or use Abilities that cost 0 Actions.
        It's both a blessing and a curse!
