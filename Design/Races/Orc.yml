Race: Orc
Description: |
  With fire in her eyes and a voice filled with righteous fury, she delivers her solemn oath: "I shall track you relentlessly, across every treacherous terrain and into the depths of the darkest abyss. I will not rest until justice is served and my fallen sistren find peace in their eternal slumber. Your deeds have brought forth an indelible wound, and it is upon my shoulders to mend it." Such is the way of the orc race, a fiercely independent and honor-bound people. Living within tightly-knit clans, they forge a society founded on principles of loyalty, strength, and an unwavering connection to the natural world. Gifted with a deep understanding of the spirits and the harmony of nature, orcs possess a wisdom that belies their imposing presence. They are not mere brutes, for they navigate the delicate balance between tribal existence and an acute awareness of the world's workings.
  Every misstep, every broken promise, echoes through the orc's being, weighing heavily upon their conscience. They are a race of sensibility, feeling every wound inflicted upon their honor to the very core of their being. The personal nature of their emotions often drives them to experience overwhelming grief, burning anger, or an unyielding sense of duty. Their autonomous societies thrive on self-sufficiency, and the orcs take great pride in constructing their own homes and procuring their sustenance. Even in the harshest circumstances, where other races might turn to others for aid, the orcs would sooner resort to pillaging and theft, for they view raiding as a form of labor rewarded by the spoils obtained.
  However, among the orcish tribes, there are those who break free from the chains of tradition and venture beyond the borders of their homelands. These individuals perceive a broader understanding of the world and its intricate mechanisms. Guided by a thirst for knowledge and the yearning to chart their own destiny, they set foot upon distant lands as intrepid adventurers.

Starting Abilities:

  ~Boiling Blood~ :
    A: 0 Actions
    Cost: Half of your current Health
    Cooldown: Once / Adventure
    Effect: |
      Use after you make a Damage roll.
      Increase the dice Damage of it by 50%.
    Notes: |
      Extra Abilities over an attack are not increased (e.g. Smite), because they are an extra Damage roll. Only increase the total numbers on the dice by 50%, rounded down, without bonuses.
      Note that some Abilities have multiple rolls, like Magic Missile, Slam, etc.

  ~Battle Anguish~ :
    A: Passive
    Effect: |
        You do not suffer Exhaustion when you are healed and rise from being Fallen in combat.
        However, after you Fall in combat, you can no longer use Abilities that Heal or cost 0 Actions (for the rest of this combat).
    Notes: This is considered a Debuff.

Starting Abilities Description:
    - Boiling Blood: |
        The lower your current Health is, the more efficient Boiling Blood is, because the less Health you spend (which needs to be healed later).
        Remember that numbers are rounded down. If you have 1 Health, you lose no Health!
        It's all about the timing!
    - Battle Anguish: |
        In combat, Orcs Fall differently from other races. After being healed while Fallen, you can use your Actions and Movement normally, without the penalties of Exhaustion.
        They suffer another downside to this, though: after you Fall once in combat, you can no longer Heal anyone or use Abilities that cost 0 Actions.
        It's both a boon and a hindrance!
