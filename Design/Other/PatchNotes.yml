Update ???:
    Sum Up:
    - This update is also quite a large one, focusing on reworking a core mechanic, removing/heavily reworking a class and bringing a lot of quality of life improvements to the game and even to the website (Desktop version)

    ⚡ Reworked Paladin Core (Tentative): |
      Even though the Paladin has been a popular class, I tend to believe it's so due to the class fantasy and certain interesting Abilities, without the core mechanics being very interesting.
      
    🏹 Reworked Hunter Core (Tentative): |
      To make things more interesting, let's double down on this idea: Hunter now no longer has Mana... at all.
      To compensate, several Talents were made stronger, Hunters have normal Health / Level and gain +1 Stat every 3 Levels.
      
    💚 Reserve Health is now Health Regen (Tentative): |
      After every Worthy combat, automatically heal for an amount equal to your Health Regen, up to 3 times per Adventure.
      Health Regen is determined by your Race, plus your Level (e.g. 6 + Level, 5 + Level, etc).
      This makes it much easier to calculate Health Regen (no more recalculating it when increasing Max Health), balance Health Regen for some characters, requires less tracking and provides more interesting options.
      As such, some Races have been rebalanced to be more interesting regarding Health Regen and Max Health.
      This is a tentative change - if it doesn't work, we'll revert back to Reserve Health, but let's give it a try!

    ✍🏼 "Replaces" (Tentative): |
      I changed the wording on several Abilities to make them easier to track on a sheet or a sheet of paper.
      Several Class Abilities now read as "Replaces X". Instead of getting a Passive new Ability that upgrades a different Ability, you get a new Ability altogether that replaces the old one.
      For most of these, there is no functional change; it's exactly the same. It's just a wording difference.
      Let me know if you feel like this is more intuitive.

    🐲 Class Feats: |
      Some Classes now have Feats! Certain awkward Talents have been made into Feats.
      As always, Feats allow for unique character builds and better customization!

    🌐 Improved various parts of the website:
    - It should now scale better with non-mobile resolutions
    - Updated main page
    - Reworked the Learn tab to now lead you to another more beautifully laid-out page
    - Reworked the Rules page to have a glossary and to be much better organized
    - Added a Custom Ability Creator page! GM's, have fun!
    - Added a Magic Items page, for GM's only. _Notice some icons glow? Click on them and see what happens!_
    - Added a Patch Notes page and the update version on the website (and changed logo)
    - The default is now Simple Mode (no more background). People have complained a lot about slow website loading and this will probably help.

    🧑🏼 Humans Reworked: |
      Humans should naturally be the simplest Race to create and play (and the way they were, Humans were the most difficulty to create). As such, Humans have been greatly simplified.

    📜 Other:
        - Removed the Conjuration Basic Ability List. Spells from it were moved to other fitting lists.
        - Changed Charmed effect (again). A Charmed Unit can't move away from the Charmer or target it.
        - Changed Feared effect (again). A Feared Unit can only do 1 Act per turn.
        - Changed starting Health of most Races
        - Added Level requirements for Druid Shapeshift
        - Vigor (3 < 4)
        - Added extra talents to some classes that were missing them, and some new talents to replace the ones that were moved to Class Feats
    

QuestGuard 2024 Roadmap:
    Intro: |
        It's been almost 1 year since QuestGuard has been on its feet, and, of course, since we've all been together here; this game would never have made it so far without the wonderful community. I am forever grateful for all the friends I've made and for all the amazing people I've met, and here's to another year of awesome people and interesting campaigns!
        Here is what I am planning with QuestGuard in the coming year.
    Dave Campaigns:
        1. Starter Adventure: |
            In the first part of 2024, I will be working on a starter adventure mini-campaign that I will wrap nicely inside a booklet, which will be available either as a separate module or part of the core rulebook.
            I aim for a 4-6 session campaign that's easy to read and introduces all the rules of QuestGuard to new players, one by one, in an easy-to-understand fashion.
            I will most likely run this campaign once or twice, and then hopefully other people can help run it as well to get feedback!
        2. Ironborn Campaign (?): |
            For the current players who took part in Nordheim, I'm planning another campaign or series of mini-campaigns aiming to continue the arcs established in Nordheim.
            This would take place in the "Outerworlds" (placeholder name) where the Ironborn resides. There, the players' new characters will explore a strange and deadly realm and meet old heroes, such as likes of Loki, Flyxer and Ilda, and find out what they've been up to.
            This is, of course, still heavily in planning; stay tuned, I'll let everyone know if and when this happens!
    QuestGuard Updates:
        Look and Feel: |
            Planned very soon, there will be a slight redesign of certain elements on the website, and I will also put together a free book template, which will reflect the book version of the game, and which players will be able to use to homebrew any type of content! I am already working with a graphic designer for this, so fingers crossed!
            There will also (finally) be an update to the mobile version of the website.
            I will also want to try out a hand-drawn version of the art on the website. Depending on whether some of the people in the community want to help or if we can make it look great, replacing AI art with human-made art is definitely something that's possible!
        Game Rules: |
            There are many things that still need work in QuestGuard as a game. Here are a few of the updates you should expect this year:
            - Level 9 Talents and Leevl 10 Ultimate Ability for all Classes
            - A complete set of Basic Abilities and Magic Items up to Level 10
            - Extra Feats and options for all Races and Classes
            - More monsters, aiming for 150 monsters by the release of the game
            Among these, we can expect to finalize several rules of the game. There will be changes still! I can already foresee some rules and core systems that will probably be changed, but ultimately there will come a point where I believe the game is in a good enough state!
        Reworks: |
            You can expect reworks of some more game elements.
            Races such as the Bertles, Davels and Elves have a nice core idea, but I think they're not very well executed. Expect changes to multiple races.
            The same goes for Classes and specializations, such as the Cleric (wink-wink) and several other specializations of other Classes. For the most part, I am content with certain classes' identities, such as the Mage and the Rogue.
            Of course, things may change. Feedback comes in all the time so let's see what happens!
        
    
    
Update 2023-10-17:
    Sum Up:
    - This update is a large one, but without focuses on _reworking_ core things but rather changing numbers for the better of the game, and adding a lot of extra content. Here is a sum-up of the changes.
    - Certain Classes and Specializations have received reworks. Other classes and specializiations have received minor changes or tweaks
    - Specific Changes:
      - Druid (Coven of the Land redesigned, and removed Coven of the Wicked specialization - it was combined with the Shaman Witch Doctor specialization)
      - Mage (Wizard and Sorcerer redesigned)
      - Shamans (complete redesign)
      - Warlocks (reworked base class, added Channeler specializiation and removed Summoner specializiation)
    - Abilities were changed to _squish_ numbers a bit - after the Defense update, numbers got a bit too large. Not nerfs/buffs, just all numbers have been slightly reduced (monster Health too)
    - Feats reimagined - Feat Points don't exist anymore. Instead, every character can freely get as many Feats as they want, up to 1 every 2 Levels. However, each individual Feat now has a cost (like Multiclassing Feats). This way, you can balance out your character, and also not feel like you're missing out if you don't get want any Feat. It will also make the game easier to parse for new players, while giving more options to veterans.
    - Main Stat removed - Main Stat is just a word for "Intelligence or Sense or Charisma, whichever is higher." While it's nice to have this generic word for it, I think the game will be easier to parse without it. Some abilities stayed the same but have different wording, some now use directly a specific Stat. It will also incentivise different stat builds. Some Abilities _changed_ but are not listed because they now display "your highest Stat" instead of "Main Stat" or were just reworded.
    - Most Classes have received Level 7 Talents, and some Level 9 Talents
    - Basic Abilities are now more evenly split throughout the Levels. This will make Leveling Up more interesting and make creating a Level 1 Character less complex.
    - Also...:
      - Lowered the number of Known Spells of certain classes for easier character creation
      - A lot of quality of life changes to certain Abilities to be simpler, more fun or more useful!

    Cleric:
    - Spread the Awe (2 Awe's instead of 3) (to fit with the new power level of spells)
    - Blessing (0 Actions < 1 Action)

    Druid:
    - Health per Level (6 < 5)
    - Shapeshift (Half-Action < 1 Action)
    - Coven of the Land has been completely reworked and is much more fun and interactive
    - Coven of the Old Ways Tweaks:
      - Day Night Cycle reworked
      - Some other Talents tweaked
      - Lycanthropy is back!
    - Wild Shape (you gain your Half-Action back when Shapeshifting)
    - (Removed) Coven of the Wicked (Shaman Witch Doctor is now akin to it)

    Hunter:
    - Lowered the damage of some Abilities to be in line with the new power level, and also reassessed how strong Hunters are.
    - At Level 1, Hunters now have 0 Mana
    - Animal Companion can't rise from being Fallen
    - Changed Tumble's effect to be more like a dodge-roll
    - Warden Tweaks:
      - Warden Ability now just gives maximum Mana
      - Quick Magic reworked
    - Beastmaster Tweaks:
      - Nerfed the Doubles Talents and changed the other Level 3 Talent
      - Ravage (5d6 /+2d6)
      - Sickem (2 attacks instead of 3)

    Mage:
    - Made some Abilities more interesting (hopefully) and changed damages to be in line with the new power level of spells.
    - All Mage specializiations now have (more or less) different Talents and are more thematic.
    - Aside from those:
        - Health per Level (5 < 4)
        - Magic Mastery (buff)

    Paladin:
    - Lay on Hands now takes a Half-Action and has a limit to prevent abuse of raising Fallen allies.
    - Adjusted some numbers and added Vigor (+4 Health).
    - Changed the names of specializiations to convey cooler class fantasies (Order of the Crusader, Order of Grace, Order of the Templar).
    - Lay on Hands ((3 + your Level + your Sense + your Charisma) < (3 + your Level + MS), at least 3 or more HP to heal)
    - Divine Smite (2d6 instead of 2d8, like it was before)

    Rogue:
    - Some slight Thief tweaks
    - Planned Assassination is now a Talent and costs 1 Mana, but deals more damage
    - Poisoned Weapons (1d8 instead of 1d12)
    - Death Mark (33% instead of 50%)

    Shaman: |
        The core identity of Shamans has been changed. While the Shaman specializiations and spirit animals were pretty cool, they didn't have a common mechanic that ties them together.
        Now, all Shamans have an Echoes Ability, which sometimes repeats the a Spell cast!
        Other than that, the Berserker specializiation is back, and the Witch Doctor is now the "Coven of the Wicked" Druid.

    Warlock: |
        Warlock has been very much reworked - they had a bit too much going on at Level 1.
        I've been warning warlocks about the coming _nerfs_ for a while.
        A lot of their Abilities have been removed for the better. The Summoner Specialization is also being removed next Updated in favor of the Channeler Specialization, which is still incomplete but has a cleaner identity.
        The Summoner is interesting by concept, but not by design (it's awkward to use and has way too much text overall). The Summoner might be coming back in a future update, when I can figure out how to properly and cleanly do the concept. In the meantime, the Summoner is staying only for the current Summoner Warlock players.

    Warrior:
    - Made tweaks to specializiations, adjusted some numbers and added Vigor (+4 Health).
    - Reckless Attack (2d6 instead of 2d8 and you take only half damage)
    - Crosshair Shot (7 meters max instead of 8)
    - Harpoon (1d12 + 3 < 1d12 + MS)

      - Reckless Attack no longer costs Mana, but you take the full Damage
      - Undying Rage is now a Level 5 Talent, is stronger and doesn't cost Mana

      - Scatterblast (3d8 + 2 < 4d8 + 3)
