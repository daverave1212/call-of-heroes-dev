Update ???:

    Reworked Elemental Ability List: |
        The Elemental Spell School felt quite random - it had some interesting spells, but many boring ones, and not many combos to pick.
        Now it's a lot more interesting, with fresh combos, playstyles and strategies to mix and match, and should work much better with Mages and Warlocks!
        Click on the icon!

    Abilities Lists (Other):
        - Renamed Deathfire Bolt to Deathflame Bolt
   
    Mage:
        - Wizard - Changed Conjurism to Electromancy
   
    Shaman Changes:
        - Changed Echoes - After casting a Basic Ability, roll 1d10. If you rolled 10, the Ability _echoes_.
        - Renamed Seer to Sage (because the Seer didn't really see all that well)
        - Base Mana increased (2 < 1)
        - Berserker - Moved Bloodlust as a Level 3 Talent. Echoing Strikes and Cold Vigor are baseline Abilities for the Berserker (with some changes). Also made some other small changes.
        - Why It's Changed_ - Previously, since the Echoes were based on the roll itself, there existed "objectively best" Abilities to use (e.g. Flame Bolt or Eldritch Blast), which limited true player choice. Now it should be much more even.

    Warlock:
        - Renamed Hexblade to Cursewielder (for copyright reasons)
        - Cursewielder - Added a Once / Turn cooldown so 1-Handed Weapons are no longer at an advantage. Also synchronizez with the new Elemental Spells.

    Website Updates:
        - Added actual descriptions to all classes
        - Updated the character sheets to be in line with the updated rules (removed Spell Grade, made some more space, fixed some bugs)
        - Further improved the look and feel for the mobile website. Still more left to do!
        
    Other:
        - Renamed Game Master to Quest Master
        - Improved the Discord group's roles
        - Removed all redundant Feats that no longer work due to the last few updates

Update 2024-01-x:
    Sum Up: |
        This update is a continuation of the previous one, on New Year's Eve.
        It focuses on removing another character sheet space (Spell Grade) while keeping spells interesting, and improving certain mechanics and rulings, especially Cover, Checks and percentages.
        It also revises the _Adventure_ system and transforms it into the _Quest_ system.
    
    Spell Grade Removed & Crowd Control Buffed: |
        _Why It's Changed:_ I'd been really thinking of why this number exists. It's just that - a number. With the changes on the wording of Checks, I think this number no longer serves a purpose. The aim of the game is to be as easy to understand as possible, without taking away from complexity. Fare well, Spell Grade! You might be missed, but I won't!
        Spell Grade has been removed and replaced with something else, which differs on a case-by-case basis. Some Abilities require the monster to make a Check (against a specified number or stat), others will have you make the Check instead. Others will have you make a Check against an enemy's Check! Other Abilities will no longer need a Check at all, and the effect simply happens.
        This works together with the Crowd Control buff - I reanalyzed how strong Crowd Control is and came to the conclusion that a lot of it is not useful enough, mathematically speaking. A lot of Crowd Control Abilities have been made stronger by removing the Check from the enemy, or by making the requirement easier.
        However, this is not the case for stronger CC like Stuns and Roots! There is genuinely a lot to unpack - a lot of Abilities have been modified. Check them out!
    
    Checks Reworded: |
        To make it more clear to players and GM's alike, Abilities now state that a Unit make a Check *at least* a number. No more debate of whether getting an equal number is a pass or a fail.
        There was actually no change to suggested Check difficulty. If you roll a 15, you still pass a "difficult" Check or such. The wording is mostly for Abilities.
        I thought this was relevant enough to add to the update notes.
    
    Cover, Blind & Percentages (Tentative): |
        Made Cover reduce Damage by 50% (tentative).
        You're free to continue playing with the -2 rule, but I'd love to see some feedback on the 50% rule.
        _Why It's Changed:_ I want to remove as many strange numbers as I can, to reduce the player likelihood of asking "is this before or after 50% resistance?". However, if this proves to be too much for just Cover, we'll revert the change.
        
        All percentages are now calculated in players' favor. If you "reduce all incoming Fire Damage by 50%", you take 2 Damage instead of 5, but the monster takes 3 Damage instead of 5. The GM can choose to overrule this.
        _A reminder that percentages are additive - 50% reduction with 50% reduction = 100% reduction, NOT 50% of 50%._
        
    Quest System (Tentative): |
        Trying out changing the Adventure system to the Quest system. A completed Quest (or Sidequest) is a milestone for the players. When the players reach that milestone in the story (complete a Quest), they regain all resources. In short:
        Players regain all resources upon completing a Quest. Players heal for an amount equal to their Health Regen when completing a Sidequest.
        The Game Master decides what a Completed Quest or Sidequest is - it could be the end of a dungeon, saving someone, or finishing the game session.
        Players can relearn Abilities and Talents after completing a Quest.
        A Quest may or may not have a clearly defined start or end.
        As a GM, feel free to say a Quest is complete whenever you feel the players need to recover their resources. If the players ask "Was this a quest?" you have the option to say "It was a Sidequest".
        _Why It's Changed:_ There are several reasons I believe Quests may be a better system. While writing the starter adventure Whispervale (spoilers), I realized it's difficult to organize it into Adventures. The Quest system, however, made room for a clearly defined time when players get back their resources. Quests also give a bit more direction to GM's for when to say "the Adventure is finished", and with Sidequests, it gives players some more extrinsic rewards for adventuring. Finally, there is a lot more flavor to Quests rather than Adventures - it feels better when you say "Quest complete!" than "Adventure finished". Quests also act like milestones and thus the reward can be Leveling Up. Need I mention it is also in the name of the game?
        
    Other Changes:
        - Changed Silence - a Silenced Unit can't use **any** Ability (not just Spells).
        - Changed Cripple - a Crippled Unit deals 100% less Damage.
        - Changed Blind - a Blinded Unit has 50% less Damage, healing and Checks.
        - Made some adjustments to armors
        - Made adjustments to Health Regen numbers

Update 2023-12-31:
    Sum Up:
    - This update is also quite a large one, focusing on reworking a core mechanic, removing/heavily reworking a class and bringing a lot of quality of life improvements to the game and even to the website (Desktop version)

    Reworked Paladin (Tentative): |
      Even though the Paladin has been a popular class, I tend to believe it's so due to the class fantasy and certain interesting Abilities, without the core mechanics being very interesting.
      Paladins have been reworked from the ground up and have their own gimmick now: they no longer have Mana. Instead, they can cast any spell they have for free, once per turn, provided they haven't already cast it already.
      Aside from that, Paladin specializations have been changed again to be more thematic and play into the class fantasy: Order of the Crusade, Order of the Tome and Order of the Templar, with Talents to double down on Paladin concepts, like being a Black or a White Knight, a Crusader, or even putting your faith on pause.
    
    Behind The Design (Paladin): |
      Paladins had nothing truly interesting going on - they were simply a class with high stats, high damage and healing.
      The Talents themselves were quite lackluster except for a few of them. Paladins also required a lot of tracking: tracking mana, tracking Holy Points, tracking Vengeance, etc.
      This update had several goals for the Paladin: reduce number tracking, make them have an interaction with Basic Abilities and simplify Talent options with more Talent interactions with the core class Abilities and between eachother.
      Overall, even if it feels like Paladins lost some power and the new Faith Casting seems unusual, I believe these will make the Paladin stand out more rules-wise and be easier and more fun to play.
      If after a while we realize that Faith Casting doesn't work and feel as planned, we'll go back to Mana.
      
    Reworked Hunter Core (Tentative): |
      To make things more interesting, let's double down on this idea: Hunter now no longer has Mana either... at all.
      To compensate, several Talents were made stronger, Hunters have normal Health / Level and gain +1 Stat every 3 Levels.
      Hunters have also reaceived extra Talents that were previously missing.
    
    Behind The Design (Hunter): |
      Hunters have always had an unusual power dynamic - the pet is free damage every turn, and can also act as a meat shield, and revived after every combat.
      That make it so that Hunters had 0 Mana, low Health (which discouraged a more melee playstyle) and could not afford some more powerful Talents.
      Removing Mana altogether from the Hunter means it can focus on what it does best and what is most fun, without having to trade off power in other areas.
      
    Reserve Health is now Health Regen (Tentative): |
      After every Worthy combat, automatically heal for an amount equal to your Health Regen, up to 3 times per Adventure.
      Health Regen is determined by your Race, plus your Level, plus your Might (e.g. 6 + Level, 5 + Level, etc).
      This makes it much easier to calculate Health Regen (no more recalculating Reserve Health when increasing Max Health), balance Health Regen for some characters, requires less tracking and provides more interesting options.
      As such, some Races have been rebalanced to be more interesting regarding Health Regen and Max Health.
      This is a tentative change - if it doesn't work, we'll revert back to Reserve Health, but let's give it a try!

    Replaces Keyword (Tentative): |
      I changed the wording on several Abilities to make them easier to track on a sheet or a sheet of paper.
      Several Class Abilities now read as "Replaces X". Instead of getting a Passive new Ability that upgrades a different Ability, you get a new Ability altogether that replaces the old one.
      For most of these, there is no functional change; it's exactly the same. It's just a wording difference.
      Let me know if you feel like this is more intuitive or not.

    Class Feats: |
      Some Classes now have Feats! Certain awkward Talents have been made into Feats instead.
      As always, Feats allow for unique character builds and better customization, all while being completely optional! More is better!
      We have Talents such as Lich Ritual (now available for Mages and Warlocks too), Old Ritual and Lycanthropy for Druids and Lone Wolf for Hunters. More to come
    
    Affliction Feats: |
      Added a new category for Feats called Afflictions. These are (at first glance at least) negative conditions for the character: missing an arm or a leg, being blind or deaf or having a chronic illness.
      I don't think anyone has played with these so far, but it's a good punishment from the GM in case they want to cut off a leg or two, or be affected by radiation poisoning in the eyes!
    
    Humans Reworked: |
      Humans should naturally be the simplest Race to create and play (and the way they were, Humans were the most difficulty to create). As such, Humans have been greatly simplified.

    Cool new website updates!:
      - You can now literally copy a spell and paste it in paint or any image editor. Try it! (as such, removed the Spell Sheet Maker page for now)
      - Added a Magic Items page, for GM's only. _Notice some icons glow? Click on them and see what happens!_
      - Added a Custom Ability Creator page! GM's and creators, have fun!
      - Updated main page
      - Reworked the Learn tab to now lead you to another more beautifully laid-out page
      - Reworked the Rules page to have a glossary and be much better organized
      - Added a Patch Notes page and the update version on the website (and changed logo)
      - The default is now Simple Mode (no more background). People have complained a lot about slow website loading and this will probably help.
      - Website should now scale better with non-mobile resolutions. There will be a mobile update some time in the future

    Other:
        - Renamed a lot of Abilities for copyright reasons. More to come
        - Removed the Conjuration Basic Ability List. Spells from it were moved to other fitting lists.
        - Reworked the Divine Basic Ability List.
        - Changed Charmed effect (again). A Charmed Unit can't move away from the Charmer or target it.
        - Changed Feared effect (again). A Feared Unit can only do 1 Act per turn.
        - Changed starting Health of most Races
        - Added Level requirements for Druid Shapeshift
        - Vigor (3 < 4)
        - Added extra talents to some classes that were missing them, and some new talents to replace the ones that were moved to Class Feats
    

QuestGuard 2024 Roadmap:
    Intro: |
        It's been almost 1 year since QuestGuard has been on its feet, and, of course, since we've all been together here; this game would never have made it so far without the wonderful community. I am forever grateful for all the friends I've made and for all the amazing people I've met, and here's to another year of awesome people and interesting campaigns!
        Here is what I am planning with QuestGuard in the coming year.
    Dave Campaigns:
        1. Starter Adventure: |
            In the first part of 2024, I will be working on a starter adventure mini-campaign that I will wrap nicely inside a booklet, which will be available either as a separate module or part of the core rulebook.
            I aim for a 4-6 session campaign that's easy to read and introduces all the rules of QuestGuard to new players, one by one, in an easy-to-understand fashion.
            I will most likely run this campaign once or twice, and then hopefully other people can help run it as well to get feedback!
        2. Ironborn Campaign (?): |
            For the current players who took part in Nordheim, I'm planning another campaign or series of mini-campaigns aiming to continue the arcs established in Nordheim.
            This would take place in the "Outerworlds" (placeholder name) where the Ironborn resides. There, the players' new characters will explore a strange and deadly realm and meet old heroes, such as likes of Loki, Flyxer and Ilda, and find out what they've been up to.
            This is, of course, still heavily in planning; stay tuned, I'll let everyone know if and when this happens!
    QuestGuard Updates:
        Look and Feel: |
            Planned very soon, there will be a slight redesign of certain elements on the website, and I will also put together a free book template, which will reflect the book version of the game, and which players will be able to use to homebrew any type of content! I am already working with a graphic designer for this, so fingers crossed!
            There will also (finally) be an update to the mobile version of the website.
            I will also want to try out a hand-drawn version of the art on the website. Depending on whether some of the people in the community want to help or if we can make it look great, replacing AI art with human-made art is definitely something that's possible!
        Game Rules: |
            There are many things that still need work in QuestGuard as a game. Here are a few of the updates you should expect this year:
            - Level 9 Talents and Leevl 10 Ultimate Ability for all Classes
            - A complete set of Basic Abilities and Magic Items up to Level 10
            - Extra Feats and options for all Races and Classes
            - More monsters, aiming for 150 monsters by the release of the game
            Among these, we can expect to finalize several rules of the game. There will be changes still! I can already foresee some rules and core systems that will probably be changed, but ultimately there will come a point where I believe the game is in a good enough state!
            Some things that I will want to experiment with are reworking Spell Grade, some extra roleplaying rules, trying out some different variants of Inspiration points, and more.
        Reworks: |
            You can expect several reworks of some more game elements. The first class on the list to be reworked is the Cleric.
            Races such as the Bertles, Davels and Elves have a nice core idea, but I think they're not very well executed. Expect changes to multiple races.
            The same goes for certain Classes and specializations.
            Of course, things may change. Feedback comes in all the time so let's see what happens!
        Other: |
            Expect also that many things be renamed, especially monsters and Abilities. Let's try to avoid copyright infringement!
    
    
Update 2023-10-17:
    Sum Up:
    - This update is a large one, but without focuses on _reworking_ core things but rather changing numbers for the better of the game, and adding a lot of extra content. Here is a sum-up of the changes.
    - Certain Classes and Specializations have received reworks. Other classes and specializiations have received minor changes or tweaks
    - Specific Changes:
      - Druid (Coven of the Land redesigned, and removed Coven of the Wicked specialization - it was combined with the Shaman Witch Doctor specialization)
      - Mage (Wizard and Sorcerer redesigned)
      - Shamans (complete redesign)
      - Warlocks (reworked base class, added Channeler specializiation and removed Summoner specializiation)
    - Abilities were changed to _squish_ numbers a bit - after the Defense update, numbers got a bit too large. Not nerfs/buffs, just all numbers have been slightly reduced (monster Health too)
    - Feats reimagined - Feat Points don't exist anymore. Instead, every character can freely get as many Feats as they want, up to 1 every 2 Levels. However, each individual Feat now has a cost (like Multiclassing Feats). This way, you can balance out your character, and also not feel like you're missing out if you don't get want any Feat. It will also make the game easier to parse for new players, while giving more options to veterans.
    - Main Stat removed - Main Stat is just a word for "Intelligence or Sense or Charisma, whichever is higher." While it's nice to have this generic word for it, I think the game will be easier to parse without it. Some abilities stayed the same but have different wording, some now use directly a specific Stat. It will also incentivise different stat builds. Some Abilities _changed_ but are not listed because they now display "your highest Stat" instead of "Main Stat" or were just reworded.
    - Most Classes have received Level 7 Talents, and some Level 9 Talents
    - Basic Abilities are now more evenly split throughout the Levels. This will make Leveling Up more interesting and make creating a Level 1 Character less complex.
    - Also...:
      - Lowered the number of Known Spells of certain classes for easier character creation
      - A lot of quality of life changes to certain Abilities to be simpler, more fun or more useful!

    Cleric:
    - Spread the Awe (2 Awe's instead of 3) (to fit with the new power level of spells)
    - Blessing (0 Actions < 1 Action)

    Druid:
    - Health per Level (6 < 5)
    - Shapeshift (Half-Action < 1 Action)
    - Coven of the Land has been completely reworked and is much more fun and interactive
    - Coven of the Old Ways Tweaks:
      - Day Night Cycle reworked
      - Some other Talents tweaked
      - Lycanthropy is back!
    - Wild Shape (you gain your Half-Action back when Shapeshifting)
    - (Removed) Coven of the Wicked (Shaman Witch Doctor is now akin to it)

    Hunter:
    - Lowered the damage of some Abilities to be in line with the new power level, and also reassessed how strong Hunters are.
    - At Level 1, Hunters now have 0 Mana
    - Animal Companion can't rise from being Fallen
    - Changed Tumble's effect to be more like a dodge-roll
    - Warden Tweaks:
      - Warden Ability now just gives maximum Mana
      - Quick Magic reworked
    - Beastmaster Tweaks:
      - Nerfed the Doubles Talents and changed the other Level 3 Talent
      - Ravage (5d6 /+2d6)
      - Sickem (2 attacks instead of 3)

    Mage:
    - Made some Abilities more interesting (hopefully) and changed damages to be in line with the new power level of spells.
    - All Mage specializiations now have (more or less) different Talents and are more thematic.
    - Aside from those:
        - Health per Level (5 < 4)
        - Magic Mastery (buff)

    Paladin:
    - Lay on Hands now takes a Half-Action and has a limit to prevent abuse of raising Fallen allies.
    - Adjusted some numbers and added Vigor (+4 Health).
    - Changed the names of specializiations to convey cooler class fantasies (Order of the Crusader, Order of Grace, Order of the Templar).
    - Lay on Hands ((3 + your Level + your Sense + your Charisma) < (3 + your Level + MS), at least 3 or more HP to heal)
    - Divine Smite (2d6 instead of 2d8, like it was before)

    Rogue:
    - Some slight Thief tweaks
    - Planned Assassination is now a Talent and costs 1 Mana, but deals more damage
    - Poisoned Weapons (1d8 instead of 1d12)
    - Death Mark (33% instead of 50%)

    Shaman: |
        The core identity of Shamans has been changed. While the Shaman specializiations and spirit animals were pretty cool, they didn't have a common mechanic that ties them together.
        Now, all Shamans have an Echoes Ability, which sometimes repeats the a Spell cast!
        Other than that, the Berserker specializiation is back, and the Witch Doctor is now the "Coven of the Wicked" Druid.

    Warlock: |
        Warlock has been very much reworked - they had a bit too much going on at Level 1.
        I've been warning warlocks about the coming _nerfs_ for a while.
        A lot of their Abilities have been removed for the better. The Summoner Specialization is also being removed next Updated in favor of the Channeler Specialization, which is still incomplete but has a cleaner identity.
        The Summoner is interesting by concept, but not by design (it's awkward to use and has way too much text overall). The Summoner might be coming back in a future update, when I can figure out how to properly and cleanly do the concept. In the meantime, the Summoner is staying only for the current Summoner Warlock players.

    Warrior:
    - Made tweaks to specializiations, adjusted some numbers and added Vigor (+4 Health).
    - Reckless Attack (2d6 instead of 2d8 and you take only half damage)
    - Crosshair Shot (7 meters max instead of 8)
    - Harpoon (1d12 + 3 < 1d12 + MS)
    - Fighter Tweaks:
      - Quick Maneuvers is now the default Ability for Fighters.
      - (Removed) Overpower
      - Opportunity Attacks is a separate default Fighter Ability now.
      - Moved Upper Hand as a Level 3 Talent which now reads "You can Advanced Flank twice per turn."
    - Barbarian Tweaks:
      - Onslaught now tells you the HP of an Enemy if below 25%
      - Reckless Attack no longer costs Mana, but you take the full Damage
      - Undying Rage is now a Level 5 Talent, is stronger and doesn't cost Mana
    - Marksman:
      - Scatterblast (3d8 + 2 < 4d8 + 3)

    Bertle:
    - I Am Speed (tweaked)

    Davel:
    - Stat restrictions are now less restrictive
    - Demon Ancestriy (tweaked)

    Dragonborn:
    - (Removed) Breath - Cone
    - (New) Breath - Area
    - Dragon's Breath (2d6 + 2 < 2d6 + MS)
    - Forceful Breath (2d8 + 3 < 3d6)

    Human:
    - Ignorance is Bliss (tweaked)

    Orc:
    - Adaptability (tweaked)

    Basic Abilities:
    - Text: A lot of Basic Abilities have received tweaks and cool new effects in addition to the number changes.
    - (New) Halfhand Attack (Default Move)
    - (New) Examine Monster (Default Move)
    - (Changed) Blood Foment (now a Reaction that stops multi-attacks)

    - (Removed) Thunder Clap
    - (Removed) Willpower Aura
    - (Removed) Control Flames
    - (Removed) Control Water

    - Muscle Tear (new effect)
    - Panic Lash (3d4 < 4d4)
    - Atonement (Damage 5 + Sense < 5 + MS)
    - Row Through (1d4 < 1d6)
    - Acid Burst (1d6 + 2 < 1d6 + MS and new Effect)
    - Flame Bolt (2d8 (+1d6) < 2d8 + MS and new Effect)
    - Land Breack (3d6 < 3d6 + 1, and ignores Cover)

    - Explosion Rune (6d4 < 6d6)
