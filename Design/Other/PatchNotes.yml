Update ???:
    Sum Up:
    - This update is also quiet a large one, focusing on reworking a core mechanic, removing/heavily reworking a class and bringing a lot of quality of life improvements for the website (Desktop version)

    ‚ö° Saying goodbye to the Paladin (Tentative): |
      The Cleric has been the least played class since the beginning of QuestGuard.
      Even though the Paladin has been a popular class, I tend to believe it's so due to the class fantasy and certain interesting Abilities, without the core mechanics being very interesting.
      Clerics have fun core mechanic, but it's spread out thin through the specializations. The Paladin is quite the opposite - it has fun pieces, but without a great core mechanic.
      In this update, the Paladin and Cleric have been combined into a single class, also called the Cleric.
      Clerics now have 3 Specializations: Paladin, Priest and Zealot. We kept all the fun mechanics and condensed them into a single class: Awe (now called Grace), Divine Smite, Lay on Hands, Crusade, Lichdom, etc.
      
      
    üíö Reserve Health is now Health Regen (Tentative): |
      After every Worthy combat, automatically heal for an amount equal to your Health Regen, up to 3 times per Adventure.
      Health Regen is determined by your Race, plus your Level (e.g. 6 + Level, 5 + Level, etc).
      This makes it much easier to calculate Health Regen (no more recalculating it when increasing Max Health), balance Health Regen for some characters, requires less tracking and provides more interesting options.
      As such, some Races have been rebalanced to be more interesting regarding Health Regen and Max Health.
      This is a tentative change - if it doesn't work, we'll revert back to Reserve Health, but let's give it a try!

    üê≤ Class Feats: |
      Some Classes now have Feats! Certain awkward Talents have been made into Feats.
      As always, Feats allow for unique character builds and better customization!

    üåê Improved various parts of the website:
    - It should now scale better with non-mobile resolutions
    - Updated main page
    - Reworked the Learn tab to now lead you to another more beautifully laid-out page
    - Reworked the Rules page to have a glossary and to be much better organized
    - Added a Custom Ability Creator page! GM's, have fun!
    - Added a Magic Items page, for GM's only. _Notice some icons glow? Click on them and see what happens!_

    üßëüèº Changed starting Abilities for Humans to be easier: |
      Humans should naturally be the simplest Race to create and play (and the way it was now, it )

    üìú Other:
    - Changed starting Health of most Races
    - Vigor (3 < 4)
    
    
    
Update 2023-10-17:
    Sum Up:
    - This update is a large one, but without focuses on _reworking_ core things but rather changing numbers for the better of the game, and adding a lot of extra content. Here is a sum-up of the changes.
    - Certain Classes and Specializations have received reworks. Other classes and specializiations have received minor changes or tweaks
    - Specific Changes:
      - Druid (Coven of the Land redesigned, and removed Coven of the Wicked specialization - it was combined with the Shaman Witch Doctor specialization)
      - Mage (Wizard and Sorcerer redesigned)
      - Shamans (complete redesign)
      - Warlocks (reworked base class, added Channeler specializiation and removed Summoner specializiation)
    - Abilities were changed to _squish_ numbers a bit - after the Defense update, numbers got a bit too large. Not nerfs/buffs, just all numbers have been slightly reduced (monster Health too)
    - Feats reimagined - Feat Points don't exist anymore. Instead, every character can freely get as many Feats as they want, up to 1 every 2 Levels. However, each individual Feat now has a cost (like Multiclassing Feats). This way, you can balance out your character, and also not feel like you're missing out if you don't get want any Feat. It will also make the game easier to parse for new players, while giving more options to veterans.
    - Main Stat removed - Main Stat is just a word for "Intelligence or Sense or Charisma, whichever is higher." While it's nice to have this generic word for it, I think the game will be easier to parse without it. Some abilities stayed the same but have different wording, some now use directly a specific Stat. It will also incentivise different stat builds. Some Abilities _changed_ but are not listed because they now display "your highest Stat" instead of "Main Stat" or were just reworded.
    - Most Classes have received Level 7 Talents, and some Level 9 Talents
    - Basic Abilities are now more evenly split throughout the Levels. This will make Leveling Up more interesting and make creating a Level 1 Character less complex.
    - Also...:
      - Lowered the number of Known Spells of certain classes for easier character creation
      - A lot of quality of life changes to certain Abilities to be simpler, more fun or more useful!

    Cleric:
    - Spread the Awe (2 Awe's instead of 3) (to fit with the new power level of spells)
    - Blessing (0 Actions < 1 Action)

    Druid:
    - Health per Level (6 < 5)
    - Shapeshift (Half-Action < 1 Action)
    - Coven of the Land has been completely reworked and is much more fun and interactive
    - Coven of the Old Ways Tweaks:
      - Day Night Cycle reworked
      - Some other Talents tweaked
      - Lycanthropy is back!
    - Wild Shape (you gain your Half-Action back when Shapeshifting)
    - (Removed) Coven of the Wicked (Shaman Witch Doctor is now akin to it)

    Hunter:
    - Lowered the damage of some Abilities to be in line with the new power level, and also reassessed how strong Hunters are.
    - At Level 1, Hunters now have 0 Mana
    - Animal Companion can't rise from being Fallen
    - Changed Tumble's effect to be more like a dodge-roll
    - Warden Tweaks:
      - Warden Ability now just gives maximum Mana
      - Quick Magic reworked
    - Beastmaster Tweaks:
      - Nerfed the Doubles Talents and changed the other Level 3 Talent
      - Ravage (5d6 /+2d6)
      - Sickem (2 attacks instead of 3)

    Mage:
    - Made some Abilities more interesting (hopefully) and changed damages to be in line with the new power level of spells.
    - All Mage specializiations now have (more or less) different Talents and are more thematic.
    - Aside from those:
        - Health per Level (5 < 4)
        - Magic Mastery (buff)

    Paladin:
    - Lay on Hands now takes a Half-Action and has a limit to prevent abuse of raising Fallen allies.
    - Adjusted some numbers and added Vigor (+4 Health).
    - Changed the names of specializiations to convey cooler class fantasies (Order of the Crusader, Order of Grace, Order of the Templar).
    - Lay on Hands ((3 + your Level + your Sense + your Charisma) < (3 + your Level + MS), at least 3 or more HP to heal)
    - Divine Smite (2d6 instead of 2d8, like it was before)

    Rogue:
    - Some slight Thief tweaks
    - Planned Assassination is now a Talent and costs 1 Mana, but deals more damage
    - Poisoned Weapons (1d8 instead of 1d12)
    - Death Mark (33% instead of 50%)

    Shaman: |
        The core identity of Shamans has been changed. While the Shaman specializiations and spirit animals were pretty cool, they didn't have a common mechanic that ties them together.
        Now, all Shamans have an Echoes Ability, which sometimes repeats the a Spell cast!
        Other than that, the Berserker specializiation is back, and the Witch Doctor is now the "Coven of the Wicked" Druid.

    Warlock: |
        Warlock has been very much reworked - they had a bit too much going on at Level 1.
        I've been warning warlocks about the coming _nerfs_ for a while.
        A lot of their Abilities have been removed for the better. The Summoner Specialization is also being removed next Updated in favor of the Channeler Specialization, which is still incomplete but has a cleaner identity.
        The Summoner is interesting by concept, but not by design (it's awkward to use and has way too much text overall). The Summoner might be coming back in a future update, when I can figure out how to properly and cleanly do the concept. In the meantime, the Summoner is staying only for the current Summoner Warlock players.

    Warrior:
    - Made tweaks to specializiations, adjusted some numbers and added Vigor (+4 Health).
    - Reckless Attack (2d6 instead of 2d8 and you take only half damage)
    - Crosshair Shot (7 meters max instead of 8)
    - Harpoon (1d12 + 3 < 1d12 + MS)
