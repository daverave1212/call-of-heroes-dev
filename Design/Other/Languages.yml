How To Use Languages In-Game: |
  When you roleplay or do social interactions in-game, you can simply say out-of-game what language you want to use.
  You don't need to actually use a different real-life language. The languages your character speaks can be used for being able to communicate with another person, reading things in that language, or you might even be able to use your known language to impress someone and get a better offer on a quest's reward!

Languages in Custom Worlds: |
  If your Game Master has a custom world where the languages are different, ask them what counts as a Common Language, Wild Language, etc.
  As a general rule of thumb, you should also ask if the languages you want to know even exist in the world you're playing in, or if they are relevant (e.g. if you speak Goblan but there are no goblins on this continent, then there's no point in knowing Goblan).

Common Languages: |
  Common Languages are the most widely spoken languages by societies in the world you're playing in.
  Usually, everyone speaks Common (English). It's recommended that all party members can speak the same language, so they can easily understand eachother in-game.
  
  The standard Common Languages are:
  - Common
  - Dwarvish
  - Elvish

Wild Languages: |
  Wild Languages are languages spoken by more tribal societies, or less common languages from around the world.
  
  The standard Wild Languages are:
  - Orcish
  - Goblan
  - Sylvan (spoken by some forest-dwelling creatures, like Dryads)
  - Gian
  - Undran (spoken by underground societies, deep within the caves of the underdark)

Higher Languages: |
  Higher Languages are languages spoken by outworldly entities, like angels, demons or alien beings.
  Infernal is the language of demons, Celestial - the language of angels, Ancian - an old language long forgotten.
  Abyssal is a non-spoken language, used in communication by old gods, aberrations or invasive aliens. Abyssal is a telepathic language transmitting flashes of emotions or abstract images or sounds into the mind of another individual. Only those trained in Abyssal can interpret/understand Abyssal, and 'speaking' Abyssal requires a form of telepathy magic.
  Often times, when the entity 'whispers' to an individual and they feel anxiety or fear, it's simply a failure of communication/interpretation of Abyssal (though sometimes, that's exactly the point).
  
  The standard Higher Languages are:
  - Infernal (demons)
  - Celestial (angels)
  - Ancian (old common)
  - Abyssal (non-spoken language of the eldritch)

Elemental Languages: |
  Elemental Languages are used by elementals or element spirits to convey information.
  Usually, these are non-spoken languages. For example, Ignan might transmit information through the shape of flames, or Aquan through the waves of water.
  
  The standard Elemental Languages are:
  - Terran
  - Ignan
  - Aquan
  - Airan

Special Languages: |
  Special Languages are a special type of communication used by very specific individuals.
  Thieves' Cant is not exactly a language, but a way to carry out private conversations in public by using code words and phrases with double meaning, such that what you say is indistinguishable from a normal conversation. Thieves' Cant also has a written version; thieves, rogues and streetspeople might use certain markings on buildings and roads to transmit to others messages like "danger" or "hidden path"; these markings are indistinguishable from random scratches to the unaware.
  Druidic is the art of conveying information through wind, soil, bark, etc. Similar to the written version of Thieves' Cant, Druidic is indistinguishable from regular nature, but it contains messages meant for other druids through means like the way bark is growing on a tree, unusual moss formations, unusual winds, etc. These often convey messages like "monster lair", "hidden path", "healing plants ahead", etc.
  Draconic is the language of Dragons and Dragonborn, manifested through shouts, breath, body language and short words. This language comes naturally to Dragons and Dragonborn (akin to dogs barking). Some say the power of Draconic can be harnessed to unleash powerful magic. Draconic can be spoken by non-dragons, but never properly, as non-dragons lack dragon breath and the instincts necessary to manifest it perfectly. There exists a version of written Draconic, at the sight of which dragons and Dragonborn can feel the language as if it were spoken. Draconic is usually not written with words, but rather with pictograms or symbols that aim to directly stir an emotion when seen by a Dragonborn or dragon.
  
  The standard Special Languages are:
  - Thieves' Cant
  - Druidic (wind, trees, etc)
  - Draconic (shouts, breath, short words); not able to be spoken properly by non-dragons
