How To Use Languages In-Game: |
  When you roleplay or do social interactions in-game, you can simply say out-of-game what language you want to use.
  You don't need to actually use a different real-life language. The languages your character speaks can be used for being able to communicate with another person, reading things in that language, or you might even be able to use your known language to impress someone and get a better offer on a quest's reward!

Languages in Custom Worlds: |
  If your Quest Master has a custom world where the languages are different, ask them what counts as a Common Language, Wild Language, etc.
  As a general rule of thumb, you should also ask if the languages you want to know even exist in the world you're playing in, or if they are relevant (e.g. if you speak Goblan but there are no goblins on this continent, then there's no point in knowing Goblan).

Common Languages: |
  Common Languages are the most widely spoken languages by societies in the world you're playing in.
  Usually, everyone speaks Common (English). It's recommended that all party members can speak the same language, so they can easily understand eachother in-game.
  
  The standard Common Languages are:
  - Common
  - Dwarvish
  - Elvish

Wild Languages: |
  Wild Languages are languages spoken by more tribal societies, or less common languages from around the world.
  
  The standard Wild Languages are:
  - Orcish
  - Goblan
  - Sylvan (spoken by some forest-dwelling creatures, like Dryads)
  - Gian (spoken by Giants)
  - Undran (spoken by underground societies, deep within the caves of the underdark)

Higher Languages: |
  Higher Languages are languages spoken by outworldly entities, like angels, demons or alien beings.
  Infernan is the language of demons, Celestian - the language of angels, Ancian - an old language long forgotten.
  Eldritsh is a non-spoken language, used in communication by old gods, aberrations or invasive aliens. Eldritsh is a telepathic language transmitting flashes of emotions or abstract images or sounds into the mind of another individual. Only those Trained in Eldritsh can interpret/understand Eldritsh, and 'speaking' Eldritsh requires a form of telepathy magic.
  Often times, when the entity 'whispers' to an individual and they feel anxiety or fear, it's simply a failure of communication/interpretation of Eldritsh (though sometimes, that's exactly the point).
  
  The standard Higher Languages are:
  - Infernan (demons)
  - Celestian (angels)
  - Ancian (old common)
  - Eldritsh (non-spoken language of the eldritch)

Special Languages: |
  Special Languages are a special type of communication used by very specific individuals.
  Doublespeak is not exactly a language, but a way to carry out private conversations in public by using code words and phrases with double meaning, such that what you say is indistinguishable from a normal conversation. Doublespeak also has a written version; thieves, rogues and streetspeople might use deliberate writing mistakes, punctuation errors or scratch marks on buildings to warn or convey concepts or even entire sentences; these markings are indistinguishable from random scratches to the unaware. Doublespeak is an art in itself - even if every doublespeaker has their own mannerisms and idiosyncracies, one must know and recognize the patterns to be able to speak this language properly, and as such, some even consider it a poetic "language".
  Whistletone is not a spoken language, but one whistled and transmitted at long distances through sounds normally difficult to distinguish from birds or natural phenomena. Magical Whistletone speakers can even incorporate magic in the sounds they make to add extra 
  Drakan is the language of Dragons and Dragonsworn, manifested through shouts, breath, body language and short words. This language comes naturally to Dragons and Dragonsworn (akin to dogs barking). Some say the power of Drakan can be harnessed to unleash powerful magic. Drakan can be spoken by non-dragons, but never properly, as non-dragons lack dragon breath and the instincts necessary to manifest it perfectly. There exists a version of written Drakan, at the sight of which dragons and Dragonsworn can feel the language as if it were spoken. Drakan is usually not written with words, but rather with pictograms or symbols that aim to directly stir an emotion when seen by a Dragonsworn or dragon.
  
  The standard Special Languages are:
  - Doublespeak
  - Whistletone (a language made up of whistles, claps and snaps, audible at long ranges, but only recognizable by the knowledgeable)
  - Drakan (shouts, breath, short words); not able to be spoken properly by non-dragons
  - Sign Language; can be used to communicate silently and at a short-medium distance. A party member that knows Sign Language can teach it to another inbetween Adventures.
