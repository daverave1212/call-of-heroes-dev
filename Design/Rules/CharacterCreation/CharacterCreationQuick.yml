Character Creation:
  Intro: |
    This section explains how to quickly create your character and fill your character sheet.
    Every subsection of character creation will explain the related rules.
  Character Sheet: |
    You can download the form-fillable PDF version of the character sheet at Database, Other, Character Sheet (PDF).
  What Makes A Character: |
    Every character is a combination of a Race, a Class.
    You can find all the available Races under Database, Races and all Classes under Database, Classes.
    Think of a Race and Class combination that you would like to play. You can browse them to get an idea for what they are, or you can decide based on what sounds cool to you.
    There is no "background", like in other games.

Filling the Character Sheet:
  Intro: |
    Character creation can be done as follows:
    First, fill in your stats.
    Second, fill in all the data from your Race.
    Third, fill in all the data from your Class.

  Stats: |
    Every Call of Heroes character's capabilities are represented by 5 Stats: Might (strength and resistance), Dexterity (agility and reflexes), Sense (the 5 senses, intuition and willpower), Intelligence (knowledge and magic) and Charisma (people skills).
    When you create your character, take the following numbers and assign each of them to a Stat: -1, 0, 1, 2, 3.
  Race Stats: |
    Every Race imposes some restrictions to how you can put in your Stats. For example, if you're an Elf, you need at least 1 Dexterity and 1 Intelligence.
  Stat Notes: Unlike in other games, there is no distinction between a Stat and a Stat Modifier.

Race Fill-Ins:
  Race Features: On the Race Page, scroll to Race Features. There you will see a few things in boxes. We will go through each of these brown boxes, one by one, and put them on your character sheet.

  Max Health: Race Health + Your Might
  Reserve Health: This is the small box near your Health, and it's equal to half of your Max Health, rounded down. Inbetween combat encounters, you can use as much from this Reserve Health pool to heal back up. Your Reserve Health and Max Health replenish inbetween Adventures.
  Speed: Given by your Race, at Race Features
  Languages: |
    You always speak Common. You might also speak other languages based on what your Race gives you. If it says you speak a number of languages equal to your Intelligence, this is at least 0 (e.g. you can't go negative and forget languages).
    Put these in the Languages box, the 4th box of the 4 small boxes under Stats.

Race Abilities:
  
  Abilities Explained: |
    All Feats, Spells, special powers, etc in this game are called Abilities. When you see a box with a nice little icon, a name, description, etc, that's an Ability.
    Some Abilities cost an Action or a Half-Action. Some cost 0 Actions, meaning you don't spend any actions on your turn to use them (there is no such thing as a Bonus Action).
    Some Abilities are Passive, meaning they're always there and you don't need to specify you use them - they simply are.
  
  Keeping Track of Your Abilities: |
    You can keep track of what Abilities you have (e.g. their names) in the Description section of the Character Sheet, on the right.
    There is also a page called Ability Sheet Maker (under Learn, Resources for Learning). You can use that app to add your Abilities, then click on Generate to see all your Abilities in a single place. You can take a screenshot of these or right click and save the images as PNG's. The list you made should remain saved on your browser, but this is not guaranteed to work.

  Race Abilities: |
    Every Race gives you some Abilities, listed under Abilities. You have all of them. Take note of them.
    Some Races like Dragonborn allow you to pick an extra Ability from their Ability Choices.

  Feat: |
    Everyone starts with a Feat. A Feat is just an Ability that can be picked from multiple options.
    You can find all the Feats in Database, Feats.
    There exist also Racial Feats, under Racial Feats of each Race's page.
    So, you need to pick ONE Feat from either the common Feats, or the Racial Feats.

    We recommend you pick a Racial Feat, since there are fewer options and it's easier to decide.
  
  That's All: That's all for the Race! Now, let's move to the Class.

Class Fill-Ins:

  Initiative: Your Dexterity + Your Charisma
  Initiative Explained: This refers to the order in combat. The higher your Initiative, the sooner your turn comes. There is no rolling for Initiative. You can freely swap your turn with other players who go immediately after you, though.

  Weapon Training: |
    Every Class gives you Training in one or more weapon categories.
    There are 5 weapon categories, all very simple: 1-Handed Melee, 2-Handed Melee, 1-Handed Ranged, 2-Handed Ranged and Shields.
    Think of what kind of weapons your character would use and put the Training in weapons you have in Training; it's one of the small 4 boxes under Stats.
    You will pick your actual weapon later. But, for reference, you can take a look at the Weapons under Database, Gear and Items, Weapons.
    Note that weapon attacks use either Might or Dexterity (usually). If you want more of a spell-casting playstyle, weapons might not matter as much.
  
  Armor Training: |
    There are 3 types of armor: Light armor, Medium armor and Heavy armor. Your Class determines what armor type you can wear.
    If you're Trained in Medium or Heavy armor, you are also Trained in the other armor types lighter than it.
    You can find the armor types under Database, Gear and Items, Armors. You can pick it now or leave it for later, when you pick your starting equipment.
  
  Defense: Determined by the armor you are wearing

  Defense Explained: |
    Your Defense is always equal to the Defense provided by your armor.
    Dexterity doesn't matter in Defense, unless you're Unarmored.
    Whenever you would take Damage, you substract your Defense from the Damage you take (e.g. if you would take 10 Damage and have 2 Defense, you only take 8 Damage).
    Note that some types of Damage ignore Defense, like Psychic and True Damage.

  Proficiencies: |
    In Call of Heroes, there isn't a list of skills your character can make, like in other games (e.g. Athletics, Sleight of Hand, Riding, etc).
    Instead, there are Proficiencies - things your character is generally good at. A Proficiency is just an Ability that allows you to add your Character's Level to non-combat Checks (with a d12) in certain scenarios. Like Proficiency in Acrobatics (bonus to all Checks that can be interpreted as "acrobatics") or Proficiency in Occultism (bonus to all Checks about knowing "occult" or dark information).
    A Proficiency always gives you a bonus equal to your Character's Level. So, if you want to jump from a balcony to another and you have Proficiency in Acrobatics, you make a Dexterity Check and add your Level to that Check. The final number is your result for the Check.
    
    Every Class gives you certain Proficiencies and lets you also pick a number of them, depending on your Intelligence.
    You can find a list of Proficiencies under Database, Proficiencies, All. If you want Proficiency in something and it's not there, you're free to make it up, but it must be approved by the GM.

Spell Casting:

  Mana Explained: |
    Mana is a resource you will use to use some Abilities. Some Abilities cost Mana to use. If so, you simply expend that many Mana points and you use the Ability. If you don't have enough Mana points as indicated by an Ability, you can't use that Ability.
    Your Mana points only replenish inbetween Adventures, so use them wisely.

    The cost of an Ability is indicated by a blue flame icon.

    All Classes use Mana, even non-spellcasters.

  Mana: Tick the star-circles on the bottom-right side of the character sheet to signify your Max Mana.

  Spell Grade: DEPRECATED
  Spell Grade Explained: This is the number a monster will have to roll above when making a Check against you. This is also called a Spell DC.

  Known Basic Abilities: |
    For each Adventure, you can prepare a number of Basic Abilities.
    A Basic Ability is just an Ability from the Basic Ability Lists. Every Class has access to different Ability Lists.

    The number of Basic Abilities your character knows is listed here, in the Class page.

    Feel free to browse all the Abilities (Database, Abilities, All) and choose that number of Abilities from there that your character has (from the Ability Lists your Class has access to). You can change these inbetween Adventures.

Leveling Up:

  Level Up: |
    Read this section only if your Character is higher than Level 1.
    Read it carefully to see what you get for every Level after Level 1 and add those.

Other Abilities:

  Starting Abilities: |
    You get all of these Abilities.
    Take note of them on your Character Sheet (e.g. in Description).
    If you are Level 1, then skip the following subsections.

  Specialization (Level 2): |
    At Level 2, you choose your Class Specialization.
    You have all Abilities listed under "You Start With...".
    Some Class Specializations will let you choose between some Abilities.

  Talents (Level 3+): |
    From Level 3, every 2 Levels (3, 5, 7, 9), you gain a Talent from your Class Specialization.
    Every 2 Levels, you have to pick exactly one from the options at exactly that Level. For example, at Level 5, you can NOT pick one more Talent from Level 2.

Equipment:
  Gold: |
    Unless stated otherwise by the GM, you start with 500 gold, with which you can buy any item in the Prices list (Database, Gear and Items, Prices).
    When buying items when you create your character, you have a 50% discount on all items in the Weapons and Equipment category, on the left.
