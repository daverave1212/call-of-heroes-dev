What is Call of Heroes?: |
    Call of Heroes is a modern, tabletop roleplaying game (tabletop RPG) in which a Game Master player creates and narrates a story, and other people play as individual character in this story.
    Unlike RPG video games (World of Warcraft, Skyrim, etc), in tabletop RPG's, a Game Master can create any world and story they want (based on some rules) and players can essentially do anything they want in that world or story, without being limited to only certain dialogue options or only certain mechanics.
    In a tabletop RPG, the players can do anything (or at least try)! It becomes the Game Master's responsibility to narrate what happens, play the role of non-player characters, come up with encounters and make the experience fun for the players. Having fun is the most important!
    
    A tabletop RPG is not constrained by graphics. A lot of people play on a table, with grids/mats and miniatures as characters (like in a board game). But this is not entirely necessary! Many people play without any visual aid at all, and it's all "theater of the mind"!
    Nowadays, there are online platforms to play tabletop RPG's. These offer the Game Master tools for creating maps, "tokens" that represent player characters and enemies (like 2D sprites or even 3D models that can be placed on the map) and even playing environmental music.
    And like in a board game, there are rules for both players and the Game Master to ensure that the game is fair and fun for everyone. Every player's character must have strengths and weaknesses.
    
    When players want to do something, like shooting a bow or negotiating with an NPC, the result is often determined by rolling dice.
    
How do groups work?:
    If you want to play, sometimes it's as easy as creating a character outside of a game, finding a group to play with via an online platform and just joining the game.
    However, tabletop RPG's can be so much more than just a one-time experience!
    
    Many GM's choose to run 'campaigns', which is a series of game sessions that continue from one play session to another, and expand into an overarching story and develop the players' characters' personalities and powers.
    Thus, if you want it to be a more intricate experience, you should find a group that fits you; make sure you get on well with everyone else and everyone is on the same page when it comes to playing.
    
    Each GM is different. A GM might run a story based on the Lord of the Rings books or in some made up world. Some GM's have different styles of playing - some are more focused on telling a story, others are more focused on giving the players options. Some are friendly, some... less so.
    Ultimately, just like finding a group to play board games with, you all should have roughly the same expectations and mindset. Some games are more relaxed, drinking and eating pizza. Some are more intense and take things seriously. If you find a group, make sure you ask what kind of group they are.
    
    Most groups have one Game Master and between 3 and 6 other players who play as individual characters.
    The recommended sweet spot for Call of Heroes is one Game Master and 4 to 5 other players.
    
How is it different from a board game?:
    A board game is limited by its physical pieces (cards, miniatures, board, etc).
    A tabletop RPG does not have to be limited by anything.
    When you buy a board game, you expect to be able to play the whole game with everything that comes in the box.
    However, to play Call of Heroes, you don't need anything from the box. In fact, you don't even need to buy anything! Don't want to buy mats or print out maps? Use sheets of paper and draw the board on them directly. Don't have miniatures? Use pretzels and bottle caps (sounds stupid, but it works; and we're also pretty sure you can find better replacements for them as well).
    There is no stigma in the tabletop roleplaying community for improvizing your own gaming set. In fact, it's encouraged! Many people like making terrain and props to use in their tabletop games.

What should I buy to get started?:
    Nothing.
    All you need to play are the rules and, of course, a group of people.
    All the rules for the players are free and accessible online on this website.
    We do, though, recommend you get a set of D&D Dice (it contains a 4-sided die, 6-sided die, 8-sided die, 10-sided die, 12-sided die and 20-sided die). Rolling dice is a very fun aspect of tabletop RPG's! However, if you don't have access to a set of dice, there are plenty mobile or online apps that simulate dice rolling. You should be able to buy a generic set of such dice for a maximum of $10 at a gaming store (as of 2022).
    
How do I get started?:
    It might be daunting to learn all the rules by yourself. But fret not; since Call of Heroes is mainly inspired by Dungeons and Dragons, you fill find a lot of people who play D&D and will be willing to try CoH with you!
    The easiest way to get started is to find someone who already knows how to play Call of Heroes and ask to join their game, or ask them to host a game for you and some other friends.
    If you want to try Call of Heroes specifically and you have experience with Dungeons and Dragons (5th edition or One D&D), see the page "D&D to CoH transition guide". It will provide you an easy introduction to Call of Heroes from a D&D perspective.
    If you never played a tabletop RPG but you have friends who have played Dungeons and Dragons, send them a link to the "D&D to CoH transition guide" page!
