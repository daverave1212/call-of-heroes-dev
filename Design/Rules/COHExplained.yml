What is Call of Heroes?: |
    Call of Heroes is a modern, tabletop roleplaying game (tabletop RPG) in which a Game Master player creates and narrates a story, and other people play as individual character in this story.
    Unlike RPG video games (World of Warcraft, Skyrim, etc), in tabletop RPG's, a Game Master can create any world and story they want (based on some rules) and players can essentially do anything they want in that world or story, without being limited to only certain dialogue options or only certain mechanics.
    In a tabletop RPG, the players can do anything (or at least try)! It becomes the Game Master's responsibility to narrate what happens, play the role of non-player characters, come up with encounters and make the experience fun for the players. Having fun is the most important!
    
    A tabletop RPG is not constrained by graphics. A lot of people play on a table, with grids/mats and miniatures as characters (like in a board game). But this is not entirely necessary! Many people play without any visual aid at all, and it's all "theater of the mind"!
    Nowadays, there are online platforms to play tabletop RPG's. These offer the Game Master tools for creating maps, "tokens" that represent player characters and enemies (like 2D sprites or even 3D models that can be placed on the map) and even playing environmental music.
    And like in a board game, there are rules for both players and the Game Master to ensure that the game is fair and fun for everyone. Every player's character must have strengths and weaknesses.
    
    When players want to do something, like shooting a bow or negotiating with an NPC, the result is often determined by rolling dice.
    
How do groups work?: |
    If you want to play, sometimes it's as easy as creating a character outside of a game, finding a group to play with via an online platform and just joining the game.
    However, tabletop RPG's can be so much more than just a one-time experience!
    
    Many GM's choose to run 'campaigns', which is a series of game sessions that continue from one play session to another, and expand into an overarching story and develop the players' characters' personalities and powers.
    Thus, if you want it to be a more intricate experience, you should find a group that fits you; make sure you get on well with everyone else and everyone is on the same page when it comes to playing.
    
    Each GM is different. A GM might run a story based on the Lord of the Rings books or in some made up world. Some GM's have different styles of playing - some are more focused on telling a story, others are more focused on giving the players options. Some are friendly, some... less so.
    Ultimately, just like finding a group to play board games with, you all should have roughly the same expectations and mindset. Some games are more relaxed, drinking and eating pizza. Some are more intense and take things seriously. If you find a group, make sure you ask what kind of group they are.
    
    Most groups have one Game Master and between 3 and 6 other players who play as individual characters.
    The recommended sweet spot for Call of Heroes is one Game Master and 4 to 5 other players.
    
How is it different from a board game?: |
    A board game is limited by its physical pieces (cards, miniatures, board, etc).
    A tabletop RPG does not have to be limited by anything.
    When you buy a board game, you expect to be able to play the whole game with everything that comes in the box.
    However, to play Call of Heroes, you don't need anything from the box. In fact, you don't even need to buy anything! Don't want to buy mats or print out maps? Use sheets of paper and draw the board on them directly. Don't have miniatures? Use pretzels and bottle caps (sounds stupid, but it works; and we're also pretty sure you can find better replacements for them as well).
    There is no stigma in the tabletop roleplaying community for improvizing your own gaming set. In fact, it's encouraged! Many people like making terrain and props to use in their tabletop games.

What should I buy to get started?: |
    Nothing.
    All you need to play are the rules and, of course, a group of people.
    All the rules for the players are free and accessible online on this website.
    We do, though, recommend you get a set of D&D Dice (it contains a 4-sided die, 6-sided die, 8-sided die, 10-sided die, 12-sided die and 20-sided die). Rolling dice is a very fun aspect of tabletop RPG's! However, if you don't have access to a set of dice, there are plenty mobile or online apps that simulate dice rolling. You should be able to buy a generic set of such dice for a maximum of $10 at a gaming store (as of 2022).
    
How do I get started?: |
    It might be daunting to learn all the rules by yourself. But fret not; since Call of Heroes is mainly inspired by Dungeons and Dragons, you fill find a lot of people who play D&D and will be willing to try CoH with you!
    The easiest way to get started is to find someone who already knows how to play Call of Heroes and ask to join their game, or ask them to host a game for you and some other friends.
    If you want to try Call of Heroes specifically and you have experience with Dungeons and Dragons (5th edition or One D&D), see the page "D&D to CoH transition guide". It will provide you an easy introduction to Call of Heroes from a D&D perspective.
    If you never played a tabletop RPG but you have friends who have played Dungeons and Dragons, send them a link to the "D&D to CoH transition guide" page!
    If you decide to play online, there are several platforms for playing Call of Heroes that simulate real life tables with miniatures, dice, music, etc. As of 2023, the most popular such platform is Roll20 (https://roll20.net). It is free for all players and Game Masters alike and supports many roleplaying games, including Call of Heroes.

Learning the Rules: |
    Feel free to follow this guide to learn how to play the game. Both in the book and on the official website, you will find clarifications for each and every rule. When in doubt, search it up on the website or consult the table of contents of the book for that rule.
    Aside from this written guide, there is also a video guide for both new and experienced roleplayers on our official YouTube channel or on the official Call of Heroes website.
    
    To be a player in a game, you need a Character! Don't worry about creating a character for now.
    For the rest of this guide, assume you are playing as a short and skinny, sneaky Gnome. That is your character! We'll name him Don. Yes, in this story, you are Don.

# Understanding dice
Dice: |
    Before we begin, you need to know about dice.
    Dice rolling is a core component of Call of Heroes. Whatever you want to do, it is likely you will need to roll a die for it to determine if you succeed or fail, either as a Player Character or as an NPC or monster.
    In the world of tabletop roleplaying, there exists one standard set of "polyhedral" dice - whether they are Dungeons and Dragons dice or Pathfinder dice, they are all the same and they all work.
    A set of such dice contains 7 special dice: a 4-sided die, a 6-sided die, an 8-sided die, two 10-sided dice, a 12-sided die and a 20-sided die. Only one such set will suffice for playing Call of Heroes to its full extent, though the more dice you have, the merrier!
    Each of these dice contains one number on each face: the 4-sided die goes from 1 to 4, the 6-sided die (normal die) goes from 1 to 6, and so on.
    Wherever you live, you can buy a set of roleplaying dice for less than $10 (as of 2023), usually at a board game shop or a gaming store, or, if you can't find any, you can order them online. If you can't afford that, there are plenty of mobile dice simulators. Just search "dice" on your mobile application store and there should be several free applications that mimick dice rolling!
    If you decide to play online and not at a real table, however, you don't need to buy dice and can just use online dice rolling simulators. There are many platforms for online roleplaying and they all incorporate dice rolling simulators.
    
Dice notation and calculations: |
    Whenever you see a notation like "d4", "d6", "d8", etc, these mean "4-sided die", "6-sided die", "8-sided die", etc.
    So, a die with 4 sides is called a "d4", a die with 6 sides is called a "d6", etc.
    
    If you are ever in doubt about what a certain dice notation means, you can ask your other team mates or the Game Master - one of them will surely know!
    
    Call of Heroes is a "d12 system", unlike Dungeons and Dragons and Pathfinder, which are "d20 systems". This simply means that you will use the d12 die for _a lot_ of things in Call of Heroes. The 12-sided die will be your best friend while playing Call of Heroes, so learn which one it is! Frankly, we believe it is also the prettiest die of them all! Just look at that perfect shape... beautiful!


# The basics of the game
How does it play out?: |
    Here is how a standard game session plays out:
    When everyone sits down at the table and is ready to start playing, the Game Master will start telling you how the story begins. This is usually narration in the 2nd person, addressing you all at the same time.
    "You are all sitting around a camp fire, deep in the woods. It is a cool Autumn day and the sky is clear of clouds. You are surrounded by thick shrubbery and your shadows dance as the flame flickers".
    You and your fellow players can choose to do, well, anything, at any point during the story. However, you should refrain from interrupting the Game Master while they are talking. Generally, you can ask the Game Master for any more information you think you need, and the Game Master might or might not tell you, depending on the story they are telling.
    However, a clear sign that you _can_ do something is if the Game Master says "what do you do?". That is your time to shine as a team.
    "Suddenly, a bear appears out of the thicket. What do you do?"
    And there is no correct answer. You, together, as a team, decide what you want to do. Do you want to scare off the bear? Do you run? Do you hide? Do you want to shoot an arrow at it? Do you want to cast a magic spell at it and set it on fire? Do you want to do... nothing? Of course, each of you can do something different if you have different opinions on what the best course of action is, but, fundamentally, you are all in this together.
    If you want to do something, simply say it out loud! "I want to hide from the bear" or, more directly, "I hide from the bear" (generally, when a player says "I" or "Me", they refer to their character; if you don't feel comfortable using "I", use "my character", like "My character wants to hide" or "I want my character to hide").
    This repeats on and on: the Game Master describes a situation, and you all decide how to resolve that situation. Usually, the Game Master has prepared in advance your possibilities, but, a lot of the time, the Game Master's job is to improvise and know how to deal with whatever the players decide they want to do. Being a good GM takes a lot of practice and time invested, but it is worth it!
    
    You want to _do something_. Will you succeed?


Checks: |
    So, you want to _do something. How do you determine if your character succeeds or fails at it?
    Whenever you (your character) want to do something that requires some effort, that will usually require you to make roll Check.
    A Check is a d12 die roll - you roll a 12-sided die to determine how well you do. If you get a 1, 2 or 3, that is usually pretty bad, while 10, 11 or 12 are pretty good numbers and have a higher chance to succeed.
    You as the player don't know how high you have to roll to succeed - the Game Master knows it, though, and you must trust that they are playing it fairly.
    However, it is not all that random how well you do. Naturally, a short skinny Gnome should be better at hiding than most, and a bulky barbarian should normally be better at lifting heavy objects than most.
    That is where your character's stats come in!
    
Stats: |
    Each Character's has 5 Stats: Might, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma.
    Together, they represent your Character's capabilities. When you create your character, each of them will range from -1 to 3, but they are generally balanced so you have some higher Stats and some lower Stats.
    Stats are just some numbers that represent how good your character is at that particular thing. Having -1 in a Stat means you are below average at that (yikes!), having 0 or 1 in a Stat means you (your character) are average and having 2 or 3 means you are above average or great at it!
    
    Might refers to how physically strong the character is and how much physical effort and pain the character can endure. If you have 0 Might, it means your character is pretty average at physical strength.
    Dexterity refers to how agile the character is, how good its reflexes are, how well it can maintain balance, etc. If you have 3 Dexterity, you are _really_ agile, and really good at those things!
    Intelligence refers to how many things the character knows, how well it does with magic and how good their memory is. If you have -1 Intelligence, it means the character is (no offense) fairly dumb.
    Wisdom refers to how good your intuition and senses are and how strong your willpower is. A 1 in Wisdom means you have average senses and willpower.
    Charimsa refers to how well you do in social situations, both verbally and with body language. A 2 in Charisma means you are a good communicator and people usually like you!
