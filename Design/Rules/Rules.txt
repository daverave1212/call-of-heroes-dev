### Part 1 ###

What is Call of Heroes?
Call of Heroes is a fantasy tabletop roleplaying game, heavily inspired from Dungeons and Dragons (5th Edition).
If you are already familiar with Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder or other similar games, learning Call of Heroes will be a piece of cake!


Why play Call of Heroes over other RPG's?
There are many reasons!
The game is simplified, for the better. There are fewer complicated rules and every race, class and ability is streamlined. Most things function the way you would expect them to.
As a Player, you have **lots** of options on character building! There is no such thing as 'unviable' character build. You wish to be a werewolf wielding two Greatswords? You can do that and it works.
No two characters will be the same. You have many customizable, balanced builds for each race and class.
Call of Heroes has a more modern, player-friendly approach towards everything, from character building, to combat, to being a Dungeon Master!


What does that mean for me as a Dungeon Master?
It's easier to be a DM in Call of Heroes.
The game provides you with a streamlined and easy way to create encounters and challenges for your players, and because there are more simple rules, you will have fewer things to worry about at the table, and just enjoy the game!


That being said...
Welcome to Call of Heroes.
Delve into dungeons and fight your way from zero to hero (literally)!
Enjoy!

General Rules
Here are some things you should consider when playing:
The DM always has the last word.
If a rule or an ability's wording seems ambiguous, it's the DM's call on what it means exactly (and everyone's duty to report it to Dave!).

Dice
Call of Heroes uses polyhedral dice.
A set of 7 dice should suffice.
These dice are:
4 sided dice
6 sided dice
8 sided dice
10 sided dice
12 sided dice
20 sided dice
10 sided dice (00 to 90)
These dice will be called d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20 and d100.
The rules will tell you when to use which dice.

Specific Beats General and Common Sense Beats Specific!
If an ability tells you to break the rules, you can break the rules in that specific way.
But think about it for a second. Interpret it the way your common sense tells you to interpret it.
Ask the DM. It's his/her call in the end.

Round Down!
When you would have to divide numbers, unless stated otherwise, always round down (9 divided by 2 would equal 4).



### Part 3 ###

Character Creation
Each player creates a character they will play with.
Players become stronger as they adventure. The Character Level dictates the overall power of the character. A level 5 character is much stronger than a level 1 character
Leveling up should happen when the players have accomplished enough and brutally killed enough enemies to get to the next level.
Call of Heroes has a simple experience system. The more you kill enemies, solve puzzles and explore, the more experience you gain.

Character Sheet
Here is a link to a downloadable form-fillable PDF.
You can complete your character there.
Also, note that for your spells you can use this tool.
You can print your character to have it on paper!

How many levels are there?
Player Characters usually start at Level 0 (or Level 1) and can get up to Level 10.
There are fewer levels here than in D&D and they are more tightly packed together.

Step 1 - Concept
As a player, think of the kind of character you want to play.
Firstly, what is the combat style of your character? Do you prefer to use a sword, a bow or cast balls of fire to burn your enemies alive? Perhaps you want to be a thief and stab people from behind. Or you want to be a dirty peasant and fight with your pitchfork. That also works.
Next, think of your characterâ€™s traits and personality. Male or female, height, age, physical strength, intelligence.

Make an Adventurer!
It is so much easier and more fun to roleplay a character who is an adventurer than a lone wolf, or one who is very strict on its behavior.
You will enjoy the game much more if your character gets on well with the party, as well as if it fits your DM's game and world.
Ask your DM what kind of character he or she expects you to make.
Communication pays off!

Step 2 - Your Stats
There are 5 stats in Call of Heroes, briefly explained:
Fortitude (how hard you can throw a tomato)
Dexterity (how accurately you can throw a tomato)
Intelligence (what you know about the tomato, and maybe changing its color with magic)
Wisdom (how well you smell, see and hear the tomato)
Charisma (how well you can sell that tomato)
