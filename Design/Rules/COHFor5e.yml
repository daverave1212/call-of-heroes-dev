About The Game:
    What is Questguard?: |
        Questguard is a modern tabletop roleplaying game for the younger generations who are more familiar with video games (and board games), and want a fast, rules-light alternative to the mainstream combat RPG systems, like D&D and Pathfinder. The game is easy to learn, play, and game-master, and provides tons of combat options and strategies packed in a simple set of rules for both the players and the GM.
        We created this game out of love for tabletop roleplaying games to account for our personal needs and wants.
        It is a game in the same genre as D&D and Pathfinder: it's made for a fantasy setting, has turn based combat, and standard roleplaying in social scenarios. If you've played similar games before, you will find Questguard very easy to pick up!

    Is this a D&D offspin?: |
        No. It's a different game. However, Dungeons and Dragons and Pathfinder are some of the main inspiration sources for Questguard.
        While exploring Questguard, you will find similarities to mainstream games like World of Warcraft, Divinity, Descent, and even League of Legends, all to create an easy and familiar experience to new tabletop players, and veterans alike!

CoH For D&D Players:

    D12 System: |
        Questguard is a d12 system instead of d20. When you make a check, you roll a 12-sided die and add any modifiers to it. This leads to less swingy Checks and makes adding numbers easier.
        Critical successes and failures can happen when rolling a d12 - if you roll 12 on the die, that counts as a Critical Success and it is treated as 15.
        Rolling a natural 1 is not considered a Critical failure. Instead, a Critical Failure happens when your total result is 0 or less (from a negative modifier, like having -1 in a certain Stat).
        
        When in combat, there is no rolling to hit - you roll Damage directly, and what you see is what you get! If you rolled a total of 14 on 3d6, you deal 14 Damage.
        Critical Strikes do exist in combat, but are specific to various weapons and Spells. If a weapon or Spell can Critically Strike, it is neatly mentioned in the description text (with what needs to happen for it to be a Critical Strike).
        
    Characters: |
        This section explains the basics of the player characters. Later sections describe how combat works and how Game Mastering is different from other systems.
        Like in D&D, a character needs to have a Character Sheet, which can be downloaded from Database, Other, Character Sheet (PDF).
        A character is defined by a Race and a Class (there is no background). Each Class has a different set of specializations (e.g. Paladin orders, Druid covens, etc) and each Race a set of extra colorful Ability options.
        Each Specialization provides tons of options for character customization through Talents every 2 Levels!

    Player Character Progression: |
        In Questguard, characters go from Level 1 up to Level 10. In terms of how much time and experience it takes to get from 1 to 10, it's not the equivalent of getting from 1 to 20 in D&D.
        In fact, getting from Level 1 to Level 10 in Questguard is slightly faster than going from Level 1 to Level 10 in Dungeons and Dragons.
        
        However, the levels are packed and flavorful, with constant game-changer options!
        Every 2 Levels, you get to pick a class Talent from 3 to 4 choices. These are Talents are usually powerful Abilities that define your playstyle! Thus, judging only by the number of Talents, each Specialization has over 500 possible Talent combinations, all viable!
        Leveling up happens either through Experience Points awarded by the GM (from killing monsters, completing puzzles, etc) or through a milestone system (e.g. leveling up after completing a certain part of the story).

    Character Stats: |
        Ability Scores (from D&D) are called simply Stats in Questguard.
        There are 5 Stats in Questguard: Might, Dexterity, Intelligence, Sense and Charisma.
        Strength and Constitution are combined into one single stat: Might. Might affects Damage with some weapons and your base Health. The overall Health is determined more by your Class and Talents rather than by your Might. So don't worry! You're not losing on that much Health if you choose to start with -1 Might.
        When you create your character, you assign the following numbers in any order to your Stats: 3, 2, 1, 0, -1. Every Character will have some strong Stats and some weak Stats.
        There are no tables for converting a Stat to a Modifier like in D&D. The Stats themselves are the modifiers.
        You gain extra Stat Points at Levels 4 and 8 (and maybe through some Talents).
        You might be thinking about how Races affect your Stats. Instead of giving you extra points in some Stats, Races impose some extra rules for distributing Stats. For example, Orcs allow you to put assign your Stats however you like, as long as your Might is at least 2.
        
        Unlike in D&D, there are no sub-stat Skills (Athletics, Perception, etc). Instead, all Checks are done directly with the Stat, and in some circumstances, players can choose which Stat they want to use. A GM might call for a simple Dexterity check to sneak around a sleeping ogre.
        Instead, to specialize in different skills, there exist Proficiencies - open-ended Abilities that give you a bonus equal to your Level to certain Checks. So, even if your Intelligence is low, you might still know a lot about Occultism.
        For example, if you have Proficiency in Intimidation, you will get a bonus to all rolls for intimidating, whether you want to use your Charisma or something else - perhaps you want to intimidate a battle general with your superior knowledge in war, and might roll an Intelligence Check for intimidating him!

    Combat, Turns and Actions: |
        Just like in D&D, combat happens on a map (preferably on a grid), and measurement is in meters instead of feet (each square is a 1x1 meter space).
        Each player rolls Initiative (1d12 + Initiative) to determine their turn order. Monsters have a fixed Initiative, so similar monster groups take their turns at the same time, thus increasing the speed of preparation for combat.
        
        In a turn, a Unit can move up to its speed and use 1 Action, which can be divided into 2 Half-Actions. As a general rule of thumb, an action taking 2 hands usually costs 1 Action. If it can be done with one hand, it usually takes a half action.
        Don't worry though! Each Ability is well worded and specifies how many Actions it takes to make.

        There is no Bonus Action, but there are plenty of Abilities that cost 0 Actions (are completely free and can do as many as you like per turn).
        Like in D&D, each Unit also has a Reaction they can use during other Units' turns for some situational moves.
        
        Saving Throws are called Resist Checks and are rolled with the Stat Modifier. Some Talents and Abilities grant you bonus modifiers to certain Resist Checks.

    Abilities: |
        An Ability can either mean a spell, a feature, a passive trait, etc. It's an all-encompassing word for "something you can do". Flamebolt is an Ability that requires 1 Aciton; Hamstring is an Ability that costs a Half-Action (you could do it twice per turn); Recuperate is an Ability that costs 0 Actions, so, as long as you have enough Mana, you can spam Recuperate as much as you want on your turn! Big Eyes is also an Ability, but it's passive, meaning it has an effect that is always on, and you don't need to do it manually on your turn.
        Abilities are very straight forward and usually short, and if any extra explanations are needed, they are written in fine print at the bottom of the text box.
        Aside from the name and marvelously illustrated icon, each Ability has tags for how many Actions it takes, its range, cost, etc. One quick way to differentiate Passive from Active Abilities is that Active Abilities have a square icon, while Passive Abilities have a rounder icon.
        
        Spells do not have a verbal or material component requirement, and can be just cast at will.
        Tidbit - there is a type of Crowd Control called Silence that completely blocks the flow of magic of a caster and prevents all spells from being cast.
        
        There are some exceptions to all these, of course, but if it's an exception, you'll see it written explicitly in the Ability box.
    
    Adventures and Rests: |
        In Questguard, there are no Long Rests or Short Rests. Instead, there is the concept of an Adventure.
        An Adventure is a period of gameplay defined by the GM. An Adventure could be one full dungeon, one quest, one session, or just one day outdoors adventuring.
        You regain spent resources inbetween Adventures.

    Spell Casting Systems: |
        There are two equivalents to the Spell Slot mechanic of D&D: Mana and Cooldowns.
        
        All Classes (spellcasters or not) use Mana to cast Abilities.
        Mana functions exactly like Spell Slots, but are not categorised by levels. An Ability costs a number of Mana points, which the Player Character will expend to cast that Ability.
        Thus, if you have 5 Mana (that recovers on Long Rest), you can choose to spend 2 of it on a Spell that costs 2 Mana. You'll be left with 3 Mana for the rest of the Adventure.
        You can prepare a number of Abilities from its available lists of Basic Abilities (Bloodshed, Elemental, Conjuration, Warfare, Divine, etc) and have them ready to cast. Most of the time, prepared Spells can be changed inbetween Adventures.
        Some Spells do have a character Level requirements, though! Fire Ball is only usable by Level 4 or above characters!
    
    Cooldowns: |
        Cooldown is a term borrowed from video games. It refers to a time you must wait between casts. If an Ability has a cooldown of Once / Adventure, it means you can't use it again until the next Adventure.
        Cooldowns are generally not based on time, but rather on checkpoints. Once per combat, once per Adventure, once per Turn, etc.      

    Done!: |
        That is the breakdown of the base rules! Knowing them, you will find the rest very intuitive!
