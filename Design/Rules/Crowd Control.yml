Other: |
  If a Unit gets Crowd Controlled while doing an Ability (e.g. "move, then attack"), what happens depends on the Crowd Control type:
  - Pushing, Knock Prone: everything in the Ability that would follow the movement gets cancelled
  - Cripple, Daze, Slow: Nothing happens on the spot; the Crowd Control takes effect after the Ability finishes
  - Silence: If it's a Spell, the rest of the Spell gets cancelled; otherwise nothing else happens
  - Paralyze, Stun, Sleep: The Ability gets cancelled
  - Blind: Apply the Harc Cover normally
  - Fear: Apply the Cover part of Fear normally, but the movement part happens on the Unit's turn, after the Ability finishes
