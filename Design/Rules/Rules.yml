    - Basics of Roleplaying:
        - What is Questguard?: |
            Questguard is a modern, tabletop roleplaying game (tabletop RPG) in which a Game Master player creates and narrates a story, and other people play as individual character in this story. Clal of Heroes can be seen as a better alternative to Dungeons and Dragons, with more player-friendly (and clearly written) rules, mechanics that area easier to understand, more intriguing options and digitally modern. Described directly, it's cleverly simple, modern and plainly cool! Like the games it draw inspiration from, Questguard is a combat-oriented game. While optional, fighting is a key part of Questguard. It is one aspect that Questguard excels at over its alternatives: combat is faster, more dynamic and more interesting overall, with simpler rules, but more possibilities for strategies and tactics. Combat usually happens on a grid of squares, with every player and monster taking turns to move, attack and cast magic spells!
            Unlike RPG video games (World of Warcraft, Skyrim, etc), in tabletop RPG's, a Game Master can create any world and story they want (based on some rules) and players can essentially do anything they want in that world or story, without being limited to narrow dialogue options or only certain mechanics.
            In a tabletop RPG, the players can do _anything_ (or at least try)! It becomes the Game Master's responsibility to narrate what happens, play the role of non-player characters and monsters, come up with fair encounters and make the experience fun for the players. Having fun is the most important!
            The Game Master is not the player's enemy - it is the narrator, referee and, usually, host of the game; their goal is to provide exciting experiences and stories for the players and keep the game balanced and impartial.

            A tabletop RPG is not constrained by graphics. A lot of people play on a table, with grids/mats and miniatures as characters (like in a board game). But this is not entirely necessary! Many people play without any visual aid at all, and it's all "theater of the mind"!
            Nowadays, there are online platforms to play tabletop RPG's. These offer the Game Master tools for creating maps, "tokens" that represent player characters and enemies (like 2D sprites or even 3D models that can be placed on the map) and even playing environmental music.
            And like in a board game, there are rules for both players and the Game Master to ensure that the game is fair and fun for everyone. Every player's character must have strengths and weaknesses.

            When players want to do something, like shooting a bow or negotiating with an NPC, the result is often determined by rolling dice.
        - What sessions look like: |
            A board game is limited by its physical pieces (cards, miniatures, board, etc).
            A tabletop RPG does not have to be limited by anything.
            When you buy a board game, you expect to be able to play the whole game with everything that comes in the box.
            However, to play Questguard, you don't need anything from the box. In fact, you don't even need to buy anything! Don't want to buy mats or print out maps? Use sheets of paper and draw the board on them directly. Don't have miniatures? Use pretzels and bottle caps (sounds stupid, but it works; and we're also pretty sure you can find better replacements for them as well).
            There is no stigma in the tabletop roleplaying community for improvizing your own gaming set. In fact, it's encouraged! Many people like making terrain and props to use in their tabletop games.

        - Groups (and our community): |
            If you want to play, sometimes it's as easy as creating a character outside of a game, finding a group to play with via an online platform and just joining the game.
            However, tabletop RPG's can be so much more than just a one-time experience!

            Many GM's choose to run 'campaigns', which is a series of game sessions that continue from one play session to another, and expand into an overarching story and develop the players' characters' personalities and powers.
            Thus, if you want it to be a more intricate experience, you should find a group that fits you; make sure you get on well with everyone else and everyone is on the same page when it comes to playing.

            Each GM is different. A GM might run a story based on the Lord of the Rings books or in some made up world. Some GM's have different styles of playing - some are more focused on telling a story, others are more focused on giving the players options. Some are friendly, some... less so.
            Ultimately, just like finding a group to play board games with, you all should have roughly the same expectations and mindset. Some games are more relaxed, drinking and eating pizza. Some are more intense and take things seriously. If you find a group, make sure you ask what kind of group they are.

            Most groups have one Game Master and between 3 and 6 other players who play as individual characters.
            The recommended sweet spot for Questguard is one Game Master and 4 to 5 other players.

            A play session can last as long as the group desires. Usually, you should dedicate at least 1:30 to 2 hours to a play session. A lot of players find they want to keep going after that, since time flies fast when you're having fun and making progress through the story!

            Questguard has a dedicated community on Discord where we always organize new campaigns and sessions for players both new and old.
        - How to get started: |
            You don't need to buy anything to get started.
            All you need to play are the rules and, of course, a group of people.
            All the rules for the players are free and accessible online on this website.
            We do, though, recommend you get a set of D&D Dice (it contains a 4-sided die, 6-sided die, 8-sided die, 10-sided die, 12-sided die and 20-sided die). Rolling dice is a very fun aspect of tabletop RPG's! However, if you don't have access to a set of dice, there are plenty mobile or online apps that simulate dice rolling. You should be able to buy a generic set of such dice for a maximum of $10 at a gaming store (as of 2022).
        - Learning the rules: |
            Don't worry about learning all the rules - just build a character and get going in a session. You will find a lot of rules intuitive and catch most of them while you play!
            It might be daunting to learn all the rules by yourself. But fret not; since Questguard is mainly inspired by Dungeons and Dragons, you fill find a lot of people who play D&D and will be willing to try CoH with you!
            The easiest way to get started is to find someone who already knows how to play Questguard and ask to join their game, or ask them to host a game for you and some other friends.
            If you want to try Questguard specifically and you have experience with Dungeons and Dragons (5th edition or One D&D), see the page "D&D to CoH transition guide". It will provide you an easy introduction to Questguard from a D&D perspective.
            If you never played a tabletop RPG but you have friends who have played Dungeons and Dragons, send them a link to the "D&D to CoH transition guide" page!
            If you decide to play online, there are several platforms for playing Questguard that simulate real life tables with miniatures, dice, music, etc. As of 2023, the most popular such platform is Roll20 (https://roll20.net). It is free for all players and Game Masters alike and supports many roleplaying games, including Questguard.
        - Using this guide: |
            In this guide, there are 5 sections: Questguard for Beginners, explaining the basics of roleplaying and how Questguard is different from other games, Character Creation, explaining how to create a character, step by step. Playing the Game, explaining what you can do on sessions and on your turn in combat. Core Rules (In-Depth) is a glossary of all rules of the game, in-depth, with specific circumstances and situations and disambiguations. Finally, there is the Game Master Guidlines, which contains tips and tricks for how to be a Game Master.
            You will see duplicate rules ocassionally (same rule in several places) as a reminder or as to reinforce a concept.

            Feel free to follow this guide to learn how to play the game. Both in the book and on the official website, you will find clarifications for each and every rule. When in doubt, search it up on the website or consult the table of contents of the book for that rule.
            Aside from this written guide, there is also a video guide for both new and experienced roleplayers on our official YouTube channel or on the official Questguard website.

            To be a player in a game, you need a Character! Don't worry about creating a character for now.
            For the rest of this guide, assume you are playing as a short and skinny, sneaky Gnome. That is your character! We'll name him Don. Yes, in this story, you are Don.
