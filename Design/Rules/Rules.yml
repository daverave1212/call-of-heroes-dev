# -------------------- Training --------------------
Weapon Training: |
    If you have Training in a weapon, you can attack with that weapon normally (roll weapon damage and add the Stat the weapon uses, usually Might or Dexterity).
    If you attack with a weapon you are not Trained in, you can't add the damage from your Stat to the attack and the Weapon's effect is negated.
    Note that you can still subtract your Stat if it's -1.
    
    For example, let's say you are Trained in the Shortsword (1d6 + 1 damage) and your Dexterity is 3. You attack and roll 4 on the d6, so the Shortsword's damage will be 5 (4 + 1); you add 3 from Dexterity and the final result is 8.
    If you are not Trained in the Shortsword, and roll 4 on the d6, the Shortsword's damage would be 5 (4 + 1). Since you can't add your Dexterity to the attack, the damage remains 5.
    As another example, if you have -1 Might and attack with a Pickaxe (2d4 + 5) and you are not Trained in it, your final damage is 2d4 + 4 (-1 from your Might).
    
    Races, Classes and Backgrounds can give you two types of weapon Training: Training in a specific weapon type or Training in a weapon Category.
    Training in a weapon Type means you are Trianed that weapon type exactly: Shortswords, Longbows, Rapiers, Shields, Pickaxes, etc.
    Training in a weapon Category means you are trained in ALL weapon types from that category. The categories are 1-Handed Melee, 2-Handed Melee, 1-Handed Ranged, 2-Handed Ranged, Throwing Weapons and Shields.

How To Get Weapon Training: |
    Most Races and Classes give you free Training in various weapons or weapon types, as well as some backgrounds.
    You can get Training in any weapon category by getting the Weapon Training Feat (see Feats).
    Finally, you can get Training in any weapon by spending one Inspiration Point (see Inspiration).

Thrown Weapons: |
    Thrown Weapons is a Weapon Category in itself.
    Some weapons are optionally Thrown. If you are Trained in that Weapon Type specifically (e.g. Daggers), you are Trained both in normal attacks with it and in throwing it.
    If you are Trained in 1-Handed Weapons but not Trained in Thrown Weapons specifically, you can make normal melee attacks with the weapon, but you are not Trained in throwing it (so, when throwing it, you do not add the Stat).

Shield Training: |
    If you wear a Shield and you are not Trained in Shields, you do not benfit from the shield's extra Defense.

Inspiration Training: |
    You can choose to spend 1 Inspiration Point to unlock Training in any Weapon Type (Shortswords, Longbows, Rapiers, Shields, etc).
    Inspiration Points are awarded by the Game Master for cool ideas, outstanding roleplaying or strategies or, honestly, whatever the Game Master wants to give Inspiration Points for.
    See the Inspiration page for more information.




# -------------------- Inspiration --------------------

Inspiration Points: |
    In Call of Heroes, the Game Master can give a player an Inspiration Point for a cool idea, outstanding roleplaying or strategies or, honestly, whatever the Game Master wants to give Inspiration Points for.
    Generally, you can earn an Inspiration Point for impressing the Game Master or contributing well to the game. It's up to each Game Master to decide what impresses them and when to award an Inspiration Point.
    Inspiration Points are awarded individually. We recommend that the Game Master awards 1 to 2 Inspiration Points (total, not per player) every session.
    
What Can I Do With Inspiration?: |
    Inspiration Points can be spent to improve your character or influence the tide of roleplaying.
    You can spend one Inspiration Point to gain Training in any one Weapon Type (Shortswords, Rapiers, Shields, etc) or gain one Proficiency Ability from any Background in the Backgrounds list.
    You can spend an Inspiration Point to also increase your Maximum Health by 1.
    Finally, you can also spend one Inspiration Point to nudge a situation slightly in your favor or influence the outcome of a roleplaying situation. This is up to your creativity. For example, if the GM says you can't find a Blacksmith in a town, you could say "I want to use my Inspiration to actually find a Blacksmith". Or, for another example, if you fall down a ravine, you could say "I want to use my Inspiration to have remembered to tie a rope to myself before crossing this ravine". So, in theory, you could alter the past and the present. Use your creativity!
    However, remember that the GM can refuse to allow you to use Inspiration in a way. Inspiration is meant to nudge the outcomes slightly, not alter whole timelines or create large-scale modifications to the present. Always ask the GM if you are allowed to use Inspiration this way.




# -------------------- Combat --------------------
Resistance and Weakness: |
    Resistance to a certain damage type means you only take 50% of that damage (of the final damage you take; e.g. after subtracting Defense).
    Weakness to a certain damage type means you take 150% of that damage (of the final damage you take; e.g. after subtracting Defense).
    
Throwing Weapons: |
    Some weapons state that they are "Optionally Thrown".
    That means you can throw the weapon and attack with it at range, with the same Stat and damage (unless stated othwerise).
    The range of all Thrown weapons is 5 meters.
    
    When it comes to Training, Thrown Weapons is a Weapon Category in itself.
    Some weapons are optionally Thrown. If you are Trained in that Weapon Type specifically (e.g. Daggers), you are Trained both in normal attacks with it and in throwing it.
    If you are Trained in 1-Handed Weapons but not Trained in Thrown Weapons specifically, you can make normal melee attacks with the weapon, but you are not Trained in throwing it (so, when throwing it, you do not add the Stat).
    See the Training rules for more information on how Training works.

# -------------------- Core Rules --------------------
Dice calculations: |
    To denote multiple dice of the same type rolled at the same time, you will see a number in front of the "d", like "2d4" or "5d6". That simply means "two 4-sided dice" or "five 6-sided dice". If something tells you to roll "5d6", roll five 6-sided dice all at the same time, and sum up the result!
    Sometimes, you will also need to roll multiple dice of multiple types, like "2d8 + 3d12". That means you must roll two 8-sided dice and three 12-sided dice all at the same time and sum up the result.
    You might also see other "modifiers" to dice rolls, such as "+ 3" or "- 1". That simply means you add 3 to the total number, or subtract 1 from the total number. So, such an example might be "2d6 + 2" or "2d4 + 3d10 - 5". Roll all those dice and add or subtract the number mentioned.
    In other cases, you will see other modifiers like "+ your Might" or "+ your Dexterity". These are usually self explanatory - they refer to adding your character's Might or your character's Dexterity to the final number. Such an example might be "2d6 + your Might". In this case, you roll 2d6 and add your character's Might to the final result.
