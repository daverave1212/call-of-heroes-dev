# -------------------- Training --------------------
Weapon Training: |
    If you have Training in a weapon, you can attack with that weapon normally (roll weapon damage and add the Stat the weapon uses, usually Might or Dexterity).
    If you attack with a weapon you are not Trained in, you can't add the damage from your Stat to the attack and the Weapon's effect is negated.
    Note that you still subtract your Stat if it's -1.
    
    For example, let's say you are Trained in the Shortsword (1d6 + 1 damage) and your Dexterity is 3. You attack and roll 4 on the d6, so the Shortsword's damage will be 5 (4 + 1); you add 3 from Dexterity and the final result is 8.
    If you are not Trained in the Shortsword, and roll 4 on the d6, the Shortsword's damage would be 5 (4 + 1). Since you can't add your Dexterity to the attack, the damage remains 5.
    As another example, if you have -1 Might and attack with a Pickaxe (2d4 + 5) and you are not Trained in it, your final damage is 2d4 + 4 (-1 from your Might).
    
    Races, Classes and Backgrounds can give you two types of weapon Training: Training in a specific weapon type or Training in a weapon Category.
    Training in a weapon Type means you are Trianed that weapon type exactly: Shortswords, Longbows, Rapiers, Shields, Pickaxes, etc.
    Training in a weapon Category means you are trained in ALL weapon types from that category. The categories are 1-Handed Melee, 2-Handed Melee, 1-Handed Ranged, 2-Handed Ranged, Throwing Weapons and Shields.

How To Get Weapon Training: |
    Most Races and Classes give you free Training in various weapons or weapon types, as well as some backgrounds.
    You can get Training in any weapon category by getting the Weapon Training Feat (see Feats).
    Finally, you can get Training in any weapon by spending one Inspiration Point (see Inspiration).

Thrown Weapons: |
    Thrown Weapons is a Weapon Category in itself.
    Some weapons are optionally Thrown. If you are Trained in that Weapon Type specifically (e.g. Daggers), you are Trained both in normal attacks with it and in throwing it.
    If you are Trained in 1-Handed Weapons but not Trained in Thrown Weapons specifically, you can make normal melee attacks with the weapon, but you are not Trained in throwing it (so, when throwing it, you do not add the Stat).

Shield Training: |
    If you wear a Shield and you are not Trained in Shields, you do not benfit from the shield's extra Defense.

Inspiration Training: |
    You can choose to spend 1 Inspiration Point to unlock Training in any Weapon Type (Shortswords, Longbows, Rapiers, Shields, etc).
    Inspiration Points are awarded by the Game Master for cool ideas, outstanding roleplaying or strategies or, honestly, whatever the Game Master wants to give Inspiration Points for.
    See the Inspiration page for more information.

# -------------------- Items --------------------

Using Items: |
    Most items you can use in combat take a Half-Action to make (e.g. Scrolls, Potions, Caltrops, etc).

Potions: |
    Consuming a Potion takes a Half-Action.
    
    Every Unit can safely use at most one "Potion" per in-game hour. If a brew restores Health, Mana, Movement, etc (e.g. is not a lasting buff), it counts as a "Potion". Magical foods with similar properties count as Potions. The Game Master can choose to rule something as "not a Potion", which means it can be safely consumed, as per the item's rules.    
    The second Potion consumed per hour makes the Unit suffer of Exhaustion for 1 hour.
    The third and all further Potions consumed per hour make the user pass a Grade 12 Might Check or fall to 0 Health and fall in a coma (Unconscious) for 1 hour.

Elixirs: |
    Consuming an Elixir takes a Half-Action.
    
Scrolls: |
    A scroll is usually a piece of parchment that has a Spell infused in it. When used, the Scroll releases that Spell and the scroll destroyed. Scrolls are one-time use items.
    Using a Scroll takes a Half-Action.
    You don't need to be a spellcaster to use a Scroll, or expend Mana or Insight. Scrolls ignore cooldowns on your Abilities - they have nothing to do with your own Ability Cooldowns or Costs.
    
    When using a scroll, you use your own Stats for that Spell (e.g. Main Stat, Counter Check Grade, etc).
    The scroll Spell does not benefit from effect bonuses increased by your character's Levels or by Talents. It is simply a plain copy of a Spell.
    
    As a Game Master, be careful with how you allow Players to buy scrolls from Shops. Players should not be able to buy all the scrolls they need and stock up on, say, 6 Fireball Scrolls they can just use on a whim.

# -------------------- Inspiration --------------------

Inspiration Points: |
    In Call of Heroes, the Game Master can give a player an Inspiration Point for a cool idea, outstanding roleplaying or strategies or, honestly, whatever the Game Master wants to give Inspiration Points for.
    Generally, you can earn an Inspiration Point for impressing the Game Master or contributing well to the game. It's up to each Game Master to decide what impresses them and when to award an Inspiration Point.
    Inspiration Points are awarded individually. We recommend that the Game Master awards 1 to 2 Inspiration Points (total, not per player) every session.
    
What Can I Do With Inspiration?: |
    Inspiration Points can be spent to improve your character or influence the tide of roleplaying.
    You can spend one Inspiration Point to gain Training in any one Weapon Type (Shortswords, Rapiers, Shields, etc) or gain one Proficiency Ability from any Background in the Backgrounds list.
    You can spend an Inspiration Point to also increase your Maximum Health by 1.
    Finally, you can also spend one Inspiration Point to nudge a situation slightly in your favor or influence the outcome of a roleplaying situation. This is up to your creativity. For example, if the GM says you can't find a Blacksmith in a town, you could say "I want to use my Inspiration to actually find a Blacksmith". Or, for another example, if you fall down a ravine, you could say "I want to use my Inspiration to have remembered to tie a rope to myself before crossing this ravine". So, in theory, you could alter the past and the present. Use your creativity!
    However, remember that the GM can refuse to allow you to use Inspiration in a way. Inspiration is meant to nudge the outcomes slightly, not alter whole timelines or create large-scale modifications to the present. Always ask the GM if you are allowed to use Inspiration this way.




# -------------------- Combat --------------------
Movement: |
    Every Unit can move in combat. When you see the term "move", "moving", "Movement", etc, that always refers to walking, running, jumping, etc; moving never refers to making Actions (with your hands).
    
    On your turn, you can move once a number of meters equal to your Speed.
    You can't split your Movement around Actions. You can move before or after attacking or casting a spell or doing any action, but once you move once, that's it! You can't move again until next turn! For example, you can't move 2 meters, take an Action (even if it's 0 Actions) and then move again.
    Note that you can freely switch direction while moving, if it's in the same movement. If you want, you can move in one direction for a few meters, do a 180 degree turn and move back. That is valid movement, because it doesn't divide the movement around Actions, but it's still the same movement.
    
    However, there are several ways to break this rule. There are plenty of Abilities that allow you to "continue your movement".
    Another way to circumvent this is to get the Attack-Move Feat, which allows you to make Melee Attacks and cast non-offensive Spells "while moving".
    
    Be careful when moving out of the melee attack range of a Unit! If you do, they can make a free attack on you, called an Opportunity Attack!
    
Other Movement: |
    Getting up from being Prone requires half of your total Movement. This counts as movement.
    Falling Prone intentionatley costs no movement but counts as movement.
    
    Jumping takes away from movement meters, whether vertical or horizontal.
    If you decide to jump 1 meters ahead, this still takes 1 meter of movement, as it normally would (the GM might make you roll a Check for succeeding the jump, though).
    Climbing a 2 meter wall takes 2 meters out of your movement. If you are jumping both horizontally and vertically, you only use the movement for the horizontal movement (e.g. if you jump to a ledge 1 meter away that's 1 meter tall, this only uses 1 meter; similarly, if you are jumping to a ledge 3 meters away that's 2 meters tall, this takes only 3 meters out of your movement).
    
Pushing: |
    Some Abilities "push" or "pull" Units (pulling is just pushing in the opposite direction).
    Pushing a Unit does NOT trigger Opportunity Attacks.
    Pushing a Unit does not consume that Unit's movement.
    Pushing a Unit does not count as movement for that Unit (for the sake of "continuing movement").
    
Initiative: |
    Initiative determines the order in which Units take their turns in combat.
    
    A Player Character's Initiative Bonus is equal to (their Dexterity + their Charisma).
    
    To determine turn order, at the start of a combat all Players roll 1d12 and add their Initiative Bonus to it.
    Monster units don't roll,but instead have a fixed Initiative (e.g. 10, 8, 14, etc, depending on the monster).
    Units take their turns from the highest Initiative (rolled) to the lowest. The highest result goes first, the lowest goes last.
    
    If there's a tie between a Player Unit and an enemy, the Player Unit goes before the monster (the Player Unit takes their turn first, and then the monster).
    If there's a tie between two Player Units, either can go before (they decide as a group).
    If there's a tie between two or more enemies, the GM decides which one goes before.

Opportunity Attacks: |
    When you move out of the melee attack range of another Unit, that Unit can make one attack on you.
    To clarify, when a Unit A exits the melee attack range of another Unit B, Unit B can make one attack on Unit A using its Reaction. This is called an Opportunity Attack.
    The attack can be with a 2-Handed or 1-Handed Weapon or a Spell, but can't use Mana or Abilities that use Actions.
    
    Being pushed by an Ability out of the melee attack range of a Unit does NOT give that Unit an Opportunity Attack.
    
    You _can_ push yourself with an Ability out of the melee attack range like this.


Resistance and Weakness: |
    Resistance to a certain damage type means you only take 50% of that damage (of the final damage you take; e.g. after subtracting Defense).
    Weakness to a certain damage type means you take 150% of that damage (of the final damage you take; e.g. after subtracting Defense).
    
Throwing Weapons: |
    Some weapons state that they are "Optionally Thrown".
    That means you can throw the weapon and attack with it at range, with the same Stat and damage (unless stated othwerise).
    The range of all Thrown weapons is 5 meters.
    
    When it comes to Training, Thrown Weapons is a Weapon Category in itself.
    Some weapons are optionally Thrown. If you are Trained in that Weapon Type specifically (e.g. Daggers), you are Trained both in normal attacks with it and in throwing it.
    If you are Trained in 1-Handed Weapons but not Trained in Thrown Weapons specifically, you can make normal melee attacks with the weapon, but you are not Trained in throwing it (so, when throwing it, you do not add the Stat).
    See the Training rules for more information on how Training works.

Actions: |
    Player Characters can all make one Action on their turn. This can mean attacking, casting a magic Spell, or anything you can think of that uses both your hands (usually).
    An Action is typically associated with doing something with both hands.
    You can split an Action into two Half-Actions.
    
    The term "Action" is just another word for "two Half-Actions".
    
    You can't move, take actions (even if something takes 0 Actions) and then move again. There are, however, Abilities that circumvent this.

Half-Actions: |
    Half-Actions are exactly what they sound like: using only one hand to do something is a Half-Action, and using both hands to do something is an Action.
    Essentially, on your turn, you can make 2 Half-Actions (which is the same as an Action).
    Any Action is just two Half-Actions combined. The term "Action" is just another word for "two Half-Actions".
    
    You want to attack with a 2-Handed Swords? That's 1 Action, AKA 2 Half-Actions. You use both your hands for this, and since one hand means one Half-Action, that's simply the same as one Action.
    
    If you choose to do so, you can even make a Half-Action with one hand, move 4 meters, then make another Half-Action.
    
    You don't actually need to keep track of which hand you used already! It doesn't matter you already used your right hand to make a Half-Action.
    Half-Actions are not tied to one hand or the other in particular.
    
    You CAN make 2 attacks with the same hand using 2 Half-Actions.
    If you have a shield and a 1-Handed Sword, yes, you can make 2 attacks with the same hand with the same sword. The game's weapons and numbers are balanced around this.
    
    When your character becomes more advanced, some Abilities will give you more Actions per turn! If you have a total of 2 Actions on your turn, that's exactly like having 4 Half-Actions. And you'd be able to make 4 attacks with the same hand and weapon, or one attack with a 2-Handed Weapon and 2 attacks with 1-Handed Weapon (e.g. Action Surge).
    
Line of Sight: |
    If you can see a Unit directly, you have Line of Sight to it.
    
    To clarify, if Unit A can see Unit B with their bare eyes, then Unit A has Line of Sight to Unit B.
    If Unit A can see even a little bit of the body of Unit B, then Unit A still has Line of Sight to Unit B (but attacks usually gain the Hard Cover pentalty if you can barely see the target).
    
    To use an Ability, you need Line of Sight to the center target point of where you are casting the Ability.
    
    If playing on a grid, if you target a point, you target the square that point is in. You can't normally target square intersections unless the Ability states you can.
    If you target a Unit, you must have line of sight to its square.
    There is Line of Sight from square A to square B if you can draw a line from any corner of square A to any corner of square B without any other Unit or Obstacle crossing the line.
    However, other Units' or obstacles' squares can _intersect_ the line you were drawing if it's merely tangential, and does not pass from one side of the line to the other.
    See the example below.
    
    Without magical means, Line of Sight is always 2-way. If Unit A has LoS to Unit B, then Unit B also has LoS to Unit A (assuming they look at one another).
    Transparent solid objects (e.g. windows) do not block Line of Sight, but obviously missiles like arrows and magic bolts can't go through them. Apply common sense.

Cooldown: |
    Some Abilities have a Cooldown.
    Cooldown refers to the time you must wait to use the Ability again.
    An Ability's Cooldown is represented by the _white hourglass_ icon. If an Ability has no such icon, then it has no Cooldown and can be used as often as you like.
    A Cooldown of "Long Rest" means you can use the Ability ONCE, and then can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.
    A Cooldown mentioning time (e.g. 1 hour, 1 day, etc) always refers to in-game time, not real-life time. 1 day in game can pass instantly, if the Game Master says "one day passes", for example. Like in a book, movie or video game, time in-game passes from scene to scene, according to the adventure story.

Triggering Abilities: |
    Some Abilities give you free uses of other Abilities. For example, Clerics get to cast Awe for free, even if it's on a Cooldown.
    When an Ability tells you that you can "freely cast X ignoring its Cooldown/Cost", you can cast that Ability in that moment, whether it's on Cooldown or not.
    If it's not on Cooldown, the Ability does NOT go on Cooldown if you trigger a free cast like this.
    If it's on Cooldown, the Ability remains on Cooldown.

Combat Grace Period: |
    For 10 minutes after finishing a combat encounter, all Units who participated are still considered in combat.
    Some Abilities and game mechanics (e.g. Reserve Health) require you to be out of combat to use.
    Be on your toes for a while after finishing a fight!

Mounted Combat: |
    sdsd

Falling Damage: |
    Falling more 2 meters inflicts 1d6 True damage for every meter (assuming you land on hard ground).
    E.g. falling 3 meters deals 1d6 damage, falling 4 meters deals 2d6 damage, falling 5 meters deals 3d6 damage, etc.
    Having someone fall on you deals the same True damage to you as it does to the faller.
    The Game Master might reduce the damage or mitigate it depending what you land on or if you fall onto an enemy with an attack. If you're a Game Master, consider halving the fall damage if a Unit falls intentionately on another Unit to attack it.
    

# -------------------- Spell Casting --------------------

Knowing and Learning Spells: |
    All Classes get access to some Generic Abilities. All these Spells are in Spell Lists. Some Classes get access to some Generic Abilities, and some to other Generic Abilities, depending on categories (e.g. Mages get access to all Arcane and Elemental Spells, but no access to Nature Spells).
    All Classes can pick a few of these Generic Abilities to Learn for adventuring.
    To be able to cast as Spell (AKA to have that Spell) you need to Learn it on a Long Rest. That becomes a Known Spell (you Know that Spell).
    Once you Learn a Spell, you Know it. When you see the term "Known Ability", it always refers to a Generic Ability from the Spell Lists.
    
    Different Classes have different simple rules for knowing Spells.
    Mages, for example, can know a number of Spells of any kind from the ones that are available to them (e.g. any from the Elemental, Arcane, etc, but none from Nature, Divine, etc).
    Once Known, these Spells can be cast as many times as the Cooldown and Cost allows (e.g. as long as you have enough Mana to cast it; explained later).
    Check out Mana-based Spellcasting to see how this works.
    
    Paladins, for example, have no Mana, but instead have some limits on how many Spells they can know.
    Check out Insight-based Spellcasting to see how this works.

Mana-based Spellcasting: |
    Clerics, Mages, Rogues, Warlocks and Warriors use a system of points called Mana Points.
    You have a number of Mana Points that you can spend to cast some Spells, and you regain all Mana Points back when you finish a Long Rest (7 in-game days of non-adventuring).
    
    The amount of Mana a Spell costs to cast is represented by the _blue flame_ icon and the number near it.
    
    For a clear example, let's take a look at the Mage Class. As written on the Mage rules page, Mages start with 3 Mana Points (and get 1 more total Mana every Level). Between Long Rests, the Mage can choose to spend these points on casting Spells.
    Each Spell specifies if and how many Mana Points it costs to cast. If you decide to cast Healing Surge, you must expend one Mana Point and then you are left with 2 Mana Points. It doesn't specify that Healing Surge has a Cooldown, so you can do it even twice per turn (since it takes a Half-Action) as long as you have enough Mana Points. If you don't have enough Mana Points to cast a Spell, you simply can't.
    
    When building your character, you will have to choose a number of Spells from the ones avaialble to your class - you can't have them all, there are dozens in the game! You'll pick a few Spells to have at hand. Mages, for example, start out with 4 + your Intelligence Spells. So, if your Intelligence is 3, you must pick 7 out of all the Spells Mages can choose from. These will be all the Spells you will be able to Cast until you finish your next Long Rest (7 in-game days of non-adventuring).
    This is explained in further detail later on (see Spell Lists).
    
    You can keep track of your Mana Points on a sheet of paper, with marbles, dice, etc. It is your job to keep track of your Mana Points. Don't cheat!

Insight-based Spellcasting: |
    Druids, Hunters, Paladins and Shamans don't have Mana, but instead have Insight.
    
    When you pick your spells to know (Known Spells), the total Insight required by your Known Spells can't exceed your Insight.
    The amount of Insight a Spell takes is represented by the _teal eye_ icon and the number near it.
    
    Insight Spells don't cost Mana, but generally have a Cooldown (depends on each Spell).
    
    You can keep track of your Cooldowns on a sheet of paper or with printed Spell cards.

Main Stat: |
    The Main Stat is what it sounds like: it is the primary Stat you will use for most things when using Abilities.
    Some Abilities will say you have to add your Main Stat to its damage.
    
    Most Classes allow you to pick which Stat you want your Main Stat to be, usually from Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma.

Counter Check Grade: |
    This is equal to your Main Stat + 6.
    Not only players roll Checks, but also enemies. Some Abilities force enemies to roll a Check to avoid it.
    When you make an enemy roll a Check, the Check must be equal or higher than your Counter Check Grade. If they do, they succeed; otherwise, they fail. An Ability tells you explicitly what happens on a success or failure.
    
Generic Ability: |
    A Generic Ability refers to an Ability from the Spell Lists (see Spell Lists).
    They are called Generic because multiple Classes have access to them.

Spell Lists: |
    Aside from the Abilities you get from your Race and Class, there are also some Spell Lists you have access to.
    Classes have access to different Spell Lists and can have a number of Generic Abilities chosen from them.
    
    A Spell List is simply a list of Generic Abilities. A set of Generic Abilities grouped together based on their theme and category is called a Spell List (themes like Elemental, Nature, Divine, etc).
    The text for every Ability is also in that list. Take a look at this page to familiarize yourself with them.
    
    As of 2023, there are 10 Spell Lists in the game: Bloodshed, Warfare, Elemental, Arcane, Nature, Conjuration, Mysticism, Faith, Eldritch and Divine. Clerics, for example, have access to the Conjuration and Divine Spell Lists.
    Also, Clerics can have 4 + their Intelligence Generic Abilities from these lists (Conjuration and Divine).
    Clerics have access to the Conjuration and Divine Spell Lists.
    This means that if you are a Cleric (and let's say your Intelligence is 2), you can pick 6 Spells from _any_ of those 3 Spell Lists and have them at a ready. Some of those Spells will cost Mana to use, some not.

Known Spells (Mana-based): |
    If your class is Mana-based, then your Known Spells are very straightforward.
    You can have that many Known Generic Abilities.
    You look at the Spell Lists your class has access to (e.g. Clerics have access to the Conjuration and Divine Spell Lists).
    From all those Generic Abilities, you pick a number of them and you have them at a ready. Some of those Spells will cost Mana to use, some not.
    
    If a Spell displays a blue flame icon and a number, then it costs that much Mana to cast it.
    
    These spells represent what your Character has prepared for adventuring. They function exactly like Abilities you have. On Long Rests, you can change what Spells from these Spell Lists your Character knows.
    
Known Spells (Insight-based): |
    If your class is Insight-based, you can know a number of Generic Abilities from your Spell Lists.
    When Learning your Generic Abilities from Spell Lists, the total amount of Insight of your Known Spells must not exceed your character's Insight.
    You can think of Insight as "available memory". Some Spells occupy "memory" (Insight).
    
    If you don't have enough Insight left to learn (Know) a Spell, you can't learn it.
    If a Spell displays a _teal eye_ icon and a number, then it takes up that much Insight to _know_ it. Most Insight Spells have a Long Rest Cooldown.

Relearning Spells: |
    All Classes can unlearn and re-learn their Generic Abilities when finishing a Long Rest.
    Talents can also be swapped on Long Rests.

Spell Level Requirements: |
    Some Abilities require your character to be at least of a certain Level in order to Learn.
    For example, if a Spell "Requires Level 4", your character must be Level 4 or higher to be able to Learn that Ability.
    
Free Spells: |
    You will see that some Generic Spells have no cost and no cooldown.
    The only 'cost' of these Spells is a space in your Known Spells.
    These Spells can't be freely used during a Long Rest, and then swapped. Your Spells finish changing when you finish a Long Rest. If you decide to adventure with Conjure Ammo, you can't cast it and then immediately change it to another Spell and start adventuring with 100 conjured arrows.
    As a general rule of thumb, the effect of most free Spells dissipates immediately if you ever no longer Know that Spell. A Game Master might allow exceptions to this.

# -------------------- Core Rules --------------------
Dice calculations: |
    To denote multiple dice of the same type rolled at the same time, you will see a number in front of the "d", like "2d4" or "5d6". That simply means "two 4-sided dice" or "five 6-sided dice". If something tells you to roll "5d6", roll five 6-sided dice all at the same time, and sum up the result!
    Sometimes, you will also need to roll multiple dice of multiple types, like "2d8 + 3d12". That means you must roll two 8-sided dice and three 12-sided dice all at the same time and sum up the result.
    You might also see other "modifiers" to dice rolls, such as "+ 3" or "- 1". That simply means you add 3 to the total number, or subtract 1 from the total number. So, such an example might be "2d6 + 2" or "2d4 + 3d10 - 5". Roll all those dice and add or subtract the number mentioned.
    In other cases, you will see other modifiers like "+ your Might" or "+ your Dexterity". These are usually self explanatory - they refer to adding your character's Might or your character's Dexterity to the final number. Such an example might be "2d6 + your Might". In this case, you roll 2d6 and add your character's Might to the final result.

Checks: |
    To pass a Check, your rolled total must be equal or higher than the required number.

Leveling Up: |
    In Call of Heroes, there are 10 Player Character Levels (from 1 to 10). Most characters start as Level 1 characters and progress level by level towards Level 10.
    Each Level, a character gains some Reserve Health (based on Class) and extra resources, like maximum Mana or Insight, extra available Spells, Feats, Stats, etc.
    Every 2 Levels, characters also gain a Talent from their Class - these are usually strong Abilities that define how you play your character.
    
    There are 2 ways in which PC's can level up: either through gaining Experience from killing monsters, completing tasks and puzzles, roleplaying, etc _or_ by milestones set by the Game Master. It is up to each GM to use a system that fits their own adventure
    
    The milestone system is the recommended system for most adventures, as it's easier to work with and more thematic.
    If you are using the milestone system, the Game Master will simply decide that all players level up when the GM thinks the time is right. This is generally after a boss fight or after an important story event.
    In the milestone system, there are no Experience Points.
    
    Leveling up can't happen during combat, but it is delayed to after combat.
    Upon Leveling Up, the Player Characters benefit instantly from a Long Rest (e.g. heal to full Health, regain Mana, reset Cooldowns, etc).
    As a variant rule, the Game Master can decide to not give the players a free Long Rest when Leveling up.
    
The Experience System: |
    In the Experience system, a Player needs an amount of Experience Points to Level Up. Each Player has a separate track of Experience Points, but it is recommended that Game Masters award Experience Points equally, so that all players Level Up at the same time.
    Once a player Levels Up their character, their Experience Points are spent, but they keep extra Experience they didn't spend. For example, if a Player has 500 Experience Points and they need 450 to Level Up, they Level Up and they keep 50 Experience. After that, they need to "fill up the Experience meter" again to Level Up.
    
    The amount of Experience Points required to Level Up to the next level is equal to (next level) * 100. To Level Up from Level 1 to Level 2, you need 200 Experience Points. Then, to Level up from Level 2 to Level 3, you need 300 more Experience Points. And so on.
    
    Note: If you're coming from other RPG's, note that how much Experience you need to get from a Level to another does NOT refer to ALL the Experience your character has amassed so far. From Level 1 to 2, you need 200 Experience. And from Level 2 to 3 you need 300 _more_ Experience. The total amount of Experience needed for you to be Level 3 is 500. So, no, you obviously don't need just 100 Experience to Level up every time.
    
Distributing Experience: |
    When the players as a group defeat an enemy that awards Experience, distribute that Experience evenly among all players who took part.
    If a monster was worth 200 Experience and there are 4 party members, then each party member gets 50 Experience. Monsters don't have levels in CoH, but rather each monster awards experience.
    
    The Game Master will usually announce how much Experience an encounter was worth. The GM can also award Experience for other tasks, such as getting out of a situation, solving puzzles, completing a part of the storyline, etc.

Long Resting: |
    Player Characters can decide to make a Long Rest (as a group).
    
    A Long Rest means 7 in-game days of non-adventuring and resting in a safe space. During this time, the Player Characters can do anything that's non-combat, doesn't cost Mana or Insight, etc.
    Note that Long Rests must be made in safe environments where you can safely let your guard down - you can't Long Rest inside a dungeon, forest camp, enemy keep, etc.
    
    Upon finishing a Long Rest, all Player Characters restore all Health and Reserve Health, Mana and most Ability Cooldowns.
    
    If a Long Rest is interrupted (e.g. by combat), the Long Rest must be started over.
    
    If an Ability has a Cooldown longer than 24 Hours, it does not reset.

Reserve Health Pool: |
    Equal to half of your Maximum Health, without buffs, rounded down.
    
    Reserve Health is, well, Health that you have in reserves. When not in combat, you can instantly transfer Health from your Reserve Health to your regular Health (e.g. take points from your Reserve Health to heal your Health for the same amount).
    Healing from your Reserve Health can only be done 10 minutes after a combat encounter ends.

Exhaustion: |
    An Exhausted Unit has halved movement, has only one Half-Action per turn (is Dazed) and can't use Abilities that cost Mana or Insight.
    Exhaustion is cause by going more than 24 hours without sleep, by magical effects or by overdosing on potions.
    Exhaustion is cured upon sleeping for 8 hours straight.
