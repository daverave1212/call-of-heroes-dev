- A. Intro to Questguard:
    - Basics of Questguard RPG:
        - Welcome!:
            Well met, adventurer! ..., you are in the right place!
            In this guide you will find all about roleplaying and Questguard - how to create a character, how to play the game, a glossary of all rules and a section with several tips for Quest Masters.
        # - What is a roleplaying game?:
        #     A tabletop roleplaying game (RPG) is an activity where a player called the Quest Master creates and narrates a story, and other people play as individual characters in this story.
        #     The Quest Master might describe a setting - you are a band of 4 adventurers, at the entrance to a large cave, looking for a long lost magical sword. As a team, you and the other player characters in the story can decide as a team what you want to do. Perhaps you want to charge right into the cave, or take precautions, explore the area first, or even find a nearby town and talk to people about the cave to gather more information. When you're decided what you want to do, you tell the Quest Master, which then describes what happens next.
        #     This happens again and again, similar to a "choose your own story" adventure.
        #     Unlike RPG video games (World of Warcraft, Skyrim, etc), in tabletop RPG's, a Quest Master can create any world and story they want (based on some rules) and players can essentially do anything they want in that world or story, without being limited to narrow dialogue options or only certain mechanics.
        #     In a tabletop RPG, the players can do _anything_ (or at least try)! It becomes the Quest Master's responsibility to narrate what happens, play the role of non-player characters and monsters, come up with fair encounters and make the experience fun for the players. Having fun is the most important!
        #     The Quest Master is not the player's enemy - it is the narrator, referee and, usually, host of the game; their goal is to provide exciting experiences and stories for the players and keep the game balanced and impartial.

        #     A tabletop RPG is not constrained by graphics. A lot of people play on a table, with grids/mats and miniatures as characters (like in a board game). But this is not entirely necessary! Many people play without any visual aid at all, and it's all "theater of the mind"!
        #     Nowadays, there are online platforms to play tabletop RPG's. These offer the Quest Master tools for creating maps, "tokens" that represent player characters and enemies (like 2D sprites or even 3D models that can be placed on the map) and even playing environmental music.
        #     And like in a board game, there are rules for both players and the Quest Master to ensure that the game is fair and fun for everyone. Every player's character must have strengths and weaknesses.

        #     When players want to do something, like shooting a bow or negotiating with an NPC, the result is often determined by rolling dice.
        # - What is Questguard?: |
        #     Questguard is a modern tabletop roleplaying game for the younger generations who are more familiar with video games (and board games), and want a fast, rules-light alternative to the mainstream combat RPG systems, like D&D and Pathfinder. The game is easy to learn, play, and game-master, and provides tons of combat options and strategies packed in a simple set of rules for both the players and the QM.
        #     We created this game out of love for tabletop roleplaying games to account for our personal needs and wants.
        #     It is a game in the same genre as D&D and Pathfinder: it's made for a fantasy setting, has turn based combat, and standard roleplaying in social scenarios. If you've played similar games before, you will find Questguard very easy to pick up!
        #     Questguard also puts emphasis on combats: it has awesome, special rules for battling monsters and character advancement.
        # - What sessions look like: |
        #     In a typical session, 
        #     TODO (dice apps)
        #     TODO (describe how sessions look)
        - Groups (and our community): |
            If you want to play, sometimes it's as easy as creating a character outside of a game, finding a group to play with via an online platform and just joining the game.
            However, tabletop RPG's can be so much more than just a one-time experience!

            Many QM's choose to run 'campaigns', which is a series of game sessions that continue from one play session to another, and expand into an overarching story and develop the players' characters' personalities and powers.
            Thus, if you want it to be a more intricate experience, you should find a group that fits you; make sure you get on well with everyone else and everyone is on the same page when it comes to playing.

            Each QM is different. A QM might run a story based on the Lord of the Rings books or in some made up world. Some QM's have different styles of playing - some are more focused on telling a story, others are more focused on giving the players options. Some are friendly, some... less so.
            Ultimately, just like finding a group to play board games with, you all should have roughly the same expectations and mindset. Some games are more relaxed, drinking and eating pizza. Some are more intense and take things seriously. If you find a group, make sure you ask what kind of group they are.

            Most groups have one Quest Master and between 3 and 6 other players who play as individual characters.
            The recommended sweet spot for Questguard is one Quest Master and 4 to 5 other players.

            A play session can last as long as the group desires. Usually, you should dedicate at least 1:30 to 2 hours to a play session. A lot of players find they want to keep going after that, since time flies fast when you're having fun and making progress through the story!

            Questguard has a dedicated community on Discord where we always organize new campaigns and sessions for players both new and old.
        # - How to get started: |
        #     You don't need to buy anything to get started.
        #     All you need to play are the rules and, of course, a group of people.
        #     All the rules for the players are free and accessible online on this website.
        #     We do, though, recommend you get a set of D&D Dice (it contains a 4-sided die, 6-sided die, 8-sided die, 10-sided die, 12-sided die and 20-sided die). Rolling dice is a very fun aspect of tabletop RPG's! However, if you don't have access to a set of dice, there are plenty mobile or online apps that simulate dice rolling. You should be able to buy a generic set of such dice for a maximum of $10 at a gaming store (as of 2022).
        - Learning the rules: |
            Don't worry about learning all the rules - just build a character and get going in a session. You will find a lot of rules intuitive and catch most of them while you play!
            It might be daunting to learn all the rules by yourself. But fret not; since Questguard is mainly inspired by Dungeons and Dragons, you fill find a lot of people who play D&D and will be willing to try CoH with you!
            The easiest way to get started is to find someone who already knows how to play Questguard and ask to join their game, or ask them to host a game for you and some other friends.
            If you want to try Questguard specifically and you have experience with Dungeons and Dragons (5th edition or One D&D), see the page "D&D to CoH transition guide". It will provide you an easy introduction to Questguard from a D&D perspective.
            If you never played a tabletop RPG but you have friends who have played Dungeons and Dragons, send them a link to the "D&D to CoH transition guide" page!
            If you decide to play online, there are several platforms for playing Questguard that simulate real life tables with miniatures, dice, music, etc. As of 2023, the most popular such platform is Roll20 (https://roll20.net). It is free for all players and Quest Masters alike and supports many roleplaying games, including Questguard.
        - Using this guide: |
            In this guide, there are 5 sections: Questguard for Beginners, explaining the basics of roleplaying and how Questguard is different from other games, Character Creation, explaining how to create a character, step by step. Playing the Game, explaining what you can do on sessions and on your turn in combat. Core Rules (In-Depth) is a glossary of all rules of the game, in-depth, with specific circumstances and situations and disambiguations. Finally, there is the Quest Master Guidlines, which contains tips and tricks for how to be a Quest Master.
            You will see duplicate rules ocassionally (same rule in several places) as a reminder or as to reinforce a concept.

            Feel free to follow this guide to learn how to play the game. Both in the book and on the official website, you will find clarifications for each and every rule. When in doubt, search it up on the website or consult the table of contents of the book for that rule.
            Aside from this written guide, there is also a video guide for both new and experienced roleplayers on our official YouTube channel or on the official Questguard website.

            To be a player in a game, you need a Character! Don't worry about creating a character for now.
            For the rest of this guide, assume you are playing as a short and skinny, sneaky Gnome. That is your character! We'll name him Don. Yes, in this story, you are Don.
        - Using the Website: |
            To find a certain rule, you can press Ctrl + F on a desktop (or use the Find function on mobile) to find the rule you're looking for.
            All the Races, Classes, Feats, Abilities, etc can be found under Database.
    - Dice:
        - How dice work: |
            Before we begin, you need to know about dice.
            Dice rolling is a core component of Questguard. Whatever you want to do, it is likely you will need to roll a die for it to determine if you succeed or fail, either as a Player Character or as an NPC or monster.
            In the world of tabletop roleplaying, there exists one standard set of "polyhedral" dice - whether they are Dungeons and Dragons dice or Pathfinder dice, they are all the same and they all work.
            A set of such dice contains 7 special dice: a 4-sided die, a 6-sided die, an 8-sided die, two 10-sided dice, a 12-sided die and a 20-sided die. Only one such set will suffice for playing Questguard to its full extent, though the more dice you have, the merrier!
            Each of these dice contains one number on each face: the 4-sided die goes from 1 to 4, the 6-sided die (normal die) goes from 1 to 6, and so on.
            Wherever you live, you can buy a set of roleplaying dice for less than $10 (as of 2023), usually at a board game shop or a gaming store, or, if you can't find any, you can order them online. If you can't afford that, there are plenty of mobile dice simulators. Just search "dice" on your mobile application store and there should be several free applications that mimick dice rolling!
            If you decide to play online and not at a real table, however, you don't need to buy dice and can just use online dice rolling simulators. There are many platforms for online roleplaying and they all incorporate dice rolling simulators.                
        - Dice notations: |
            Whenever you see a notation like "d4", "d6", "d8", etc, these mean "4-sided die", "6-sided die", "8-sided die", etc.
            So, a die with 4 sides is called a "d4", a die with 6 sides is called a "d6", etc. 
            If you see "d4", that means you're supposed to roll a 4-sided die and take that result.
            If you see "d6", that means you're supposed to roll a 6-sided die and take that result. And so on and so forth.
            
            If you are ever in doubt about what a certain dice notation means, you can ask your other team mates or the Quest Master - one of them will surely know!
            
            Questguard is a "d12 system", unlike Dungeons and Dragons and Pathfinder, which are "d20 systems". This simply means that you will use the d12 die for _a lot_ of things in Questguard. The 12-sided die will be your best friend while playing Questguard, so learn which one it is! Frankly, we believe it is also the prettiest die of them all! Just look at that perfect shape... beautiful!
        - Dice calculations: |
            When you see notation like "1d6 + 1d8", that simply means you roll a d6 and a d8, and you add the results together for the final result.
            Naturall, 1d6 + 4, for example, means you roll a d6 and add 4 to the result.
    - Gameplay Phases:
        - Free Roleplay: |
            Questguard is separated into 2 types of gameplay: free roleplay and Combat.
            In free roleplay, everyone is allowed to do whatever they like.
        - Combat: |
            In combat, rules change a bit and we play turn-by-turn, on a grid, and we do damage.

- B. Character Creation:
    - Starting Out:
        - What makes a Character: |    # Description
            This section explains how to quickly create your character and fill your character sheet.
            Every subsection of character creation will explain the related rules.
            Every character is a combination of a Race, a Class.
            You can find all the available Races under Database, Races and all Classes under Database, Classes.
            Think of a Race and Class combination that you would like to play. You can browse them to get an idea for what they are, or you can decide based on what sounds cool to you.
            There is no "background", like in other games, but make sure you give your character a nice back-story!
        - Your Race...: |              # Races summary
            Human, Elf, Bertle, etc.
        - Your Class...: |             # Classes summary, what you get from each class
            Refers to your combat style and "profession". Warrior, Mage, Cleric, Shaman, etc.
        - Character Sheet: |
            You can download the form-fillable PDF version of the character sheet at Database, Other, Character Sheet (PDF).
    - Filling The Sheet: 
        - The basics: |
            Character creation can be done as follows:
            First, fill in your stats.
            Second, fill in all the data from your Race.
            Third, fill in all the data from your Class.
        - Stats: |
            Every Questguard character's capabilities are represented by 5 Stats: Might (strength and resistance), Dexterity (agility and reflexes), Sense (the 5 senses, intuition and willpower), Intelligence (knowledge and magic) and Charisma (people skills).
            When you create your character, take the following numbers and assign each of them to a Stat: -1, 0, 1, 2, 3.
            Unlike in other games, there is no distinction between a Stat and a Stat Modifier.
    - A. Race Features:
        - Race Stat Distribution: |    # Include rules for extra stats
            Every Race imposes some restrictions to how you can put in your Stats. For example, if you're an Elf, you need at least 1 Dexterity and 1 Intelligence.
        - Health (HP): Determined by your Race.
        - Health Regen: |
            This is the small box near your Health, and it's given by your Race, plus your Level. Inbetween Worthy combat encounters, all Player Characters in the group automatically heal for up to that amount, but only up to 3 times per Adventure, even if not damaged. You can't 'overheal' and heal above your Max Health.
        # - Reserve Health: |
        #     This is the small box near your Health, and it's equal to half of your Max Health, rounded down. Inbetween combat encounters, you can use as much from this Reserve Health pool to heal back up. Your Reserve Health and Max Health replenish inbetween Adventures.
        - Movement Speed: Determined by your Race.
        - Languages: |
            You always speak Common. You might also speak other languages based on what your Race gives you. If it says you speak a number of languages equal to your Intelligence, this is at least 0 (e.g. you can't go negative and forget languages).
            Put these in the Languages box, the 4th box of the 4 small boxes under Stats.
        - Racial Abilities: |
            All Feats, Spells, special powers, etc in this game are called Abilities. When you see a box with a nice little icon, a name, description, etc, that's an Ability.
            Some Abilities cost an Action or a Half-Action. Some cost 0 Actions, meaning you don't spend any actions on your turn to use them (there is no such thing as a Bonus Action).
            Some Abilities are Passive, meaning they're always there and you don't need to specify you use them - they simply are.
            Every Race gives you some Abilities, listed under Abilities. You have all of them. Take note of them.
            Some Races like Dragonsworn allow you to pick an extra Ability from their Ability Choices.
        - Racial Ability Choice: |
            Every Race gets to pick one starting Ability to customize their character better.
    - B. Class Features:
        - Initiative: |
            This refers to the order in combat. When combat starts, you roll Initiative (1d12 + Initiative) and, the higher you roll, the sooner you act in combat.
        - Weapon Training: |
            Every Class gives you Training in one or more weapon categories.
            There are 5 weapon categories, all very simple: 1-Handed Melee, 2-Handed Melee, 1-Handed Ranged, 2-Handed Ranged and Shields.
            Think of what kind of weapons your character would use and put the Training in weapons you have in Training; it's one of the small 4 boxes under Stats.
            You will pick your actual weapon later. But, for reference, you can take a look at the Weapons under Database, Gear and Items, Weapons.
            Note that weapon attacks use either Might or Dexterity (usually). If you want more of a spell-casting playstyle, weapons might not matter as much.
        - Skills (Being Skilled): |
            In Questguard, there isn't a list of set Checks with bonuses written directly on your Character Sheet.
            Instead, there are Skills - non-combat activities your character is generally good at. A Skill is just an Ability that allows you to add your Character's Level to non-combat Checks (with a d12) in certain scenarios. Like Skilled in Acrobatics (bonus to all Checks that can be interpreted as "acrobatics") or Skilled in Occultism (bonus to all Checks about knowing "occult" or dark information). We call this being Skilled in a type of activity.

            A Skill (being Skilled) in an activity always gives you a bonus equal to your Character's Level when performing that activity. So, if you want to jump from a balcony to another and you have Skilled in Acrobatics, you make a Dexterity Check and add your Level to that Check. The final number is your result for the Check.

            However, Skills are often up to interpretation. For example, the Quest Master might ask you for a general Sense Check to see if you can spot the spy, and it is up to you to mention you are Skilled in something that would help you. Try to come up with a reason why your Skill can be applied in this situation!
            
            Every Class gives you certain Skills and lets you also pick a number of them, depending on your Intelligence.
            You can find a list of Skills under Database, {Proficiencies}, All. If you want to be Skilled in something and it's not there, you're free to make it up, but it must be approved by the Quest Master.
        - Class Abilities: |
            You get all of these Abilities.
            Take note of them on your Character Sheet (e.g. in Description).
        - Mana: |
            Mana is a resource you will use to use some Abilities. Some Abilities cost Mana to use. If so, you simply expend that many Mana points and you use the Ability. If you don't have enough Mana points as indicated by an Ability, you can't use that Ability.
            Your Mana points only replenish inbetween Adventures, so use them wisely.

            The cost of an Ability is indicated by a blue flame icon.

            All Classes use Mana, even non-spellcasters.

            Tick the star-circles on the bottom-right side of the character sheet to signify your Max Mana.
        - Basic (Generic) Abilities: |
            TODO # Level 1...
        - Basic Ability Lists: |
            For each Adventure, you can prepare a number of Basic Abilities.
            A Basic Ability is just an Ability from the Basic Ability Lists. Every Class has access to different Ability Lists.
        - Known Abilities: |           # Recommendations...: |
            TODO
            The number of Basic Abilities your character knows is listed here, in the Class page.

            Feel free to browse all the Abilities (Database, Abilities, All) and choose that number of Abilities from there that your character has (from the Ability Lists your Class has access to). You can change these inbetween Adventures.
    - Equipment:
        - Gold: |
            Unless stated otherwise by the QM, you start with 800 gold, with which you can buy any item in the Prices list (Database, Gear and Items, Prices).
    - Leveling Up:
        - Levels: |
            Read this section only if your Character is higher than Level 1.
            Read it carefully to see what you get for every Level after Level 1 and add those.
        - Specialization: |
            At Level 2, you choose your Class Specialization.
            You have all Abilities listed under "You Start With...".
        - Talents: |
            From Level 3, every 2 Levels (3, 5, 7, 9), you gain a Talent from your Class Specialization.
            Every 2 Levels, you have to pick exactly one from the options at exactly that Level. For example, at Level 5, you can NOT pick one more Talent from Level 2.
    - Other (Optional):
        - Feats: |
            There exist a set of extra Abilities called Feats (which you can find on the {Feats} page). These usually change how you play your character or give you some extra interesting options, but always have a cost attached (usually in Max Health, Mana, Initiative, etc).
            You can get as many of these as you can afford.
            Feats are optional, and you're not necessarily missing out if you decide to play without Feats.

- C. Playing the Game:
    - Free Roleplaying:
        - Checks: |
            So, you want to do something. How do you determine if your character succeeds or fails at it?
            Whenever you (your character) want to do something that requires some effort, that will usually require you to make roll Check.
            A Check is a d12 die roll - you roll a 12-sided die to determine how well you do. If you get a 1, 2 or 3, that is usually pretty bad, while 10, 11 or 12 are pretty good numbers and have a higher chance to succeed.
            You as the player don't know how high you have to roll to succeed - the Quest Master knows it, though, and you must trust that they are playing it fairly.
            Whether you fail or succeed, the Quest Master will let you know what happens! The QM might say "You try to hide behind a tree, but the bear's keen sense of smell detects where you are" if you fail, or "You successfully hide behind a tree, without the bear noticing" if you succeed.
            Whenever not sure what you can do, ask the QM!
            
            However, how well you do is not all completely random. Naturally, a short, skinny Gnome should be better at hiding than most, and a bulky barbarian should normally be better at lifting heavy objects than most.
            That is where your character's stats come in!
        - Social Etiquette: |
            Be nice and don't interrupt others; try to make decisions as a team.
    - Combat:
        - My turn: |
            If you decide to engage in combat (or the enemies ambush you), the way things play out change slightly.
            Tactical combat is a large part of what makes Questguard unique and an improvement over other systems.
            In combat, you can no longer make decisions whever you want, but you have to take them on your turn. Combat in all RPG's play more similarly to a board game in which you have more freedom.
            First things first, let's talk about the turn order.
        - My Actions: |
            Player Characters can all make one Action on their turn. This can mean attacking, casting a magic Spell, or anything you can think of that uses your hands (usually).
    
            The most standard way to take your turn is to move once and then attack once (or attack and then move).
            If you want to do something that uses both hands, that's an Action.
            But what if you want to do something different with each hand? That's where Half-Actions come in.

            Half-Actions are exactly what they sound like: using only one hand to do something is a Half-Action, and using both hands to do something is an Action.
            Essentially, on your turn, you can make 2 Half-Actions (which is the same as an Action).
            Any Action is just two Half-Actions combined. You want to attack with a 2-Handed Swords? That's 1 Action, AKA 2 Half-Actions. You use both your hands for this, and since one hand means one Half-Action, that's simply the same as one Action.
            The term "Action" is just another word for "two Half-Actions".
            
            If you choose to do so, you can even make a Half-Action with one hand, move 4 meters, then make another Half-Action.
            
            But it gets better! You don't actually need to keep track of which hand you used already! It doesn't matter you already used your right hand to make a Half-Action.
            On your turn, you have 2 Half-Actions. Period. They are not tied to one hand or the other in particular. You want to make 2 Half-Actions with the same hand? You are free to do so!
            If you have a shield and a 1-Handed Sword, yes, you can make 2 attacks with the same hand with the same sword. But don't worry about the numbers; the game is balanced around this.
            
            In the future, when your character becomes more advanced, some Abilities will give you more Actions per turn! If you have a total of 2 Actions on your turn, that's exactly like having 4 Half-Actions. And you'd be able to make 4 attacks with the same hand and weapon, or one attack with a 2-Handed Weapon and 2 attacks with 1-Handed Weapon. You're free to do whatever you want with your hands!

            When you attack with a weapon, you roll the weapon's dice and subtract the enemy's Defense.
    
            Every weapon in the game does a certain amount of Damage and all weapons can be found on the Weapons page.
            Every weapon also benefits from either your Might or your Dexterity.
            For example, a Club deals 1d10 Damage and uses the Might Stat. So, whenever you attack with the Club, the Damage done by that attack is 1d8 + your Might. If you are the sneaky, slim Gnome, that means 1d8 - 1, which is not very good.
            The Whip, however, deals 1d4 + 3 Damage and uses Dexterity. Thus, if you are the sneaky Gnome, the Damage will be 1d4 + 6, which is much better!
            
            You roll the Damage, and the enemy subtracts the Damage you deal from their Health Points. Your job is to get them to 0 or less Health.
            
            However, every character and monster has another number called Defense. Whenever it is attacked, their Defense reduces the amount of Damage they take by that amount.
            For example, if you attack the Bear and the attack would deal 7 Damage, the Bear does not just lose 7 Health, but instead subtracts its Defense from the attack.
            Bears' Defense is 4, so, whevener the Bear is attacked, it reduces all incoming Damage by 4. 7 becomes 3. That's the final amount of Damage the Bear takes.
            
            To conclude, the final Damage of your attack is: (Weapon Damage) + (your Might or Dexterity).
            In this particular case with you being the Gnome and the enemy being the Bear, the total Damage is (1d6 + 1) + (3) - (4).
            
            No matter if you use a 1-Handed Weapon (with Half-Actions) or a 2-Handed Weapon (with Actions), the formula is the same. Even if you use both hands, the formula doesn't change. It's always the same.
            
        - My Health and Mana: |
            How much you can resist in combat is determined by your Health Points. Every living thing in the game has Health Point (or just Health, or HP).
            You as a character have a set amount of Health Points determined by how you created your character.
            
            Whenever you take Damage, you subtract that many points from your current Health Points.
            If someone reaches 0 or less Health Points, they die (or at least fall incapacitated).
            Protect these Health Points as best you can, because they represent your life!
            
            As the sneaky Gnome you are, let's say you have a total of 12 Health Points.
            During your day of adventuring, you will undoubtedly fight enemies, fall in traps and hurt yourself.
            Whenever that happens, you will lose some of your Health Points.
            
            You regain all of your lost Health Points back when your character takes an 8-hour break from adventuring in-game, in a safe environment; this is called a Long Rest.
            Long Rests have nothing to do with real world time. You can just say "Let's take a Long Rest" and the Quest Master might just say "Done, 8 hours have passed".
            Take note that you can not Long Rest while camping in a forest, in a dungeon, wilderness, etc!
            
            During the gaming session, you will have to keep track yourself of how many Health Points you have, either on a sheet of paper or in a document. Don't cheat!
            Your total amount of Health is calculated when you create your character; we'll get into that a bit later.

- D. Core Rules (In-Depth):
    - Player Tools:
        - Character Sheets: PDF, PNG, PSD under Databases > Other; print or not. Ask Dave for examples.
        - Ability Tracker (Online): Databases > Ability Sheets (Online)
        - Ability Sheet Maker (Print): Databases > Ability Sheets (Online)

    - Combat Rundown:
        - Initiative (Turn order): |      # Monster initiative...
            Initiative determines the order in which Units take their turns in combat.
            
            A Player Character's Initiative Bonus is equal to (their Dexterity + their Charisma).
            
            To determine turn order, at the start of a combat all Players roll 1d12 and add their Initiative Bonus to it.
            Monster units don't roll,but instead have a fixed Initiative (e.g. 10, 8, 14, etc, depending on the monster).
            Units take their turns from the highest Initiative (rolled) to the lowest. The highest result goes first, the lowest goes last.
            
            If there's a tie between a Player Unit and an enemy, the Player Unit goes before the monster (the Player Unit takes their turn first, and then the monster).
            If there's a tie between two Player Units, either can go before (they decide as a group).
            If there's a tie between two or more enemies, the QM decides which one goes before.
        - Turns: A turn is a turn.
        - Rounds: A round is a round.

    - Acts and Actions:
        - Acts: |
            Simply put, doing anything willingly on your turn is considered an Act.
            Doing an Act means Moving, using a Reaction or doing anything worth 0 or more Actions. Effects triggered by or through Passives are not considered Acts.
            For example, when you Move, that is an Act. Using a the Innervate Spell takes 0 Actions, so it's an Act. When the Cleric's Passive Spell Awe triggers, that is NOT considered an Act.
            Engaging in Roleplay is not considered an Act, unless the QM decides so.
        - Actions: |
            Player Characters can all make one Action on their turn. This can mean attacking, casting a magic Spell, or anything you can think of that uses both your hands (usually).
            An Action is typically associated with doing something with both hands.
            You can split an Action into two Half-Actions.
            
            The term "Action" is just another word for "two Half-Actions".
            
            You can't move, take actions (even if something takes 0 Actions) and then move again. There are, however, Abilities that circumvent this.
        - Half-Actions: |
            Half-Actions are exactly what they sound like: using only one hand to do something is a Half-Action, and using both hands to do something is an Action.
            Essentially, on your turn, you can make 2 Half-Actions (which is the same as an Action).
            Any Action is just two Half-Actions combined. The term "Action" is just another word for "two Half-Actions".
            
            You want to attack with a 2-Handed Swords? That's 1 Action, AKA 2 Half-Actions. You use both your hands for this, and since one hand means one Half-Action, that's simply the same as one Action.
            
            If you choose to do so, you can even make a Half-Action with one hand, move 4 meters, then make another Half-Action.
            
            You don't actually need to keep track of which hand you used already! It doesn't matter you already used your right hand to make a Half-Action.
            Half-Actions are not tied to one hand or the other in particular.
            
            You CAN make 2 attacks with the same hand using 2 Half-Actions.
            If you have a shield and a 1-Handed Sword, yes, you can make 2 attacks with the same hand with the same sword. The game's weapons and numbers are balanced around this.
            
            When your character becomes more advanced, some Abilities will give you more Actions per turn! If you have a total of 2 Actions on your turn, that's exactly like having 4 Half-Actions. And you'd be able to make 4 attacks with the same hand and weapon, or one attack with a 2-Handed Weapon and 2 attacks with 1-Handed Weapon (e.g. Action Surge).

        - Reaction: |
            You have 1 Reaction per Round. Some Abilities allow you to use your Reaction. Otherwise, nothing to do with it.
        - Hands: 1 hand for something = Half-Action. Both hands = 1 Action

    - Movement:
        - Movement (Moving): |
            Every Unit can move in combat. When you see the term "move", "moving", "Movement", etc, that always refers to walking, running, jumping, etc; moving never refers to making Actions (with your hands).
            
            On your turn, you can move once a number of meters equal to your Speed.
            You can't split your Movement around Actions. You can move before or after attacking or casting a spell or doing any action, but once you move once, that's it! You can't move again until next turn! For example, you can't move 2 meters, take an Action (even if it's 0 Actions) and then move again.
            Note that you can freely switch direction while moving, if it's in the same movement. If you want, you can move in one direction for a few meters, do a 180 degree turn and move back. That is valid movement, because it doesn't divide the movement around Actions, but it's still the same movement.
            
            However, there are several ways to break this rule. There are plenty of Abilities that allow you to "continue your movement".
            Another way to circumvent this is to get the Attack-Move Feat, which allows you to make Melee Attacks and cast non-offensive Spells "while moving".
        - Breaking Movement: Move, Act then Move is Breaking movement. You can't normally Break Movement.
        - Pushing: |
            Some Abilities "push" or "pull" Units (pulling is just pushing in the opposite direction).
            Pushing a Unit does not consume that Unit's movement.
            Pushing a Unit does not count as movement for that Unit (for the sake of "continuing movement").
        - Other Movement: |
            Jumping takes away from Movement meters, whether vertical or horizontal.
            So, if you decide to jump 1 meter ahead, this still takes 1 meter of movement, as it normally would (the QM might make you roll a Check for succeeding the jump, though).
            Climbing a 2 meter wall takes 2 meters out of your movement. If you are jumping both horizontally and vertically, you only use the movement for the horizontal movement (e.g. if you jump to a ledge 1 meter away that's 1 meter tall, this only uses 1 meter; similarly, if you are jumping to a ledge 3 meters away that's 2 meters tall, this takes only 3 meters out of your movement).

            In some situations, Medium or Smaller Units might be able to fit through some squares of a certain Large or Large Unit (with QM's permission). For them, those squares count as Hard Terrain.     
        - Hard Terrain: |
            Moving inside a Hard Terrain space costs 2 meters instead of 1.

    - Combat Encounter & Units:
        - Combat Encounter: |
            When you want to fight, the game switches from free roleplay to combat.
        - Ambush: |
            If your team makes sense to ambush, you ambush
        - Unit: |
            Any acting person, monster or creature is considered a Unit (e.g. it's not inanimate and can take turns).
            Inanimate objects can be considered Units only if and when you're targeting or affecting them with attacks or Abilities, and it's necessary that they be considered Units (e.g. for certai special effects).
            The QM has the final say in whether something is a Unit or not.
        - Ally vs Enemy: |
            A friendly Unit is considered an Ally. A hostile Unit is considered an Enemy.
            Inanimate Unit objects are considered neither Allies, nor Enemies.
        - Worthy Enemy (Worthiness): |
            Certain Abilities specify that they only work against "Worthy Enemies".
            A Worthy Enemy is a normal enemy that tries to kill you during a combat encounter only.
            The following are NOT considered worthy enemies:
            - Defenseless Units (e.g. civillians, hunted deer, etc)
            - Units that don't attack or don't want to attack
            - Units killed in "time-skip combats" (quick combat, e.g. combats that happen without rolling initiative, or during roleplaying, etc)
            - Every single creature in a swarm (e.g. a single bat is not a worthy enemy, but a Bat Swarm is a worthy enemy alltogether)
        - Unit Sizes: |
            Medium and smaller Units occupy a 1x1 meter space.
            Large Units occupy a 2x2 meter space. It is up to the QM to tell how much space a Unit larger than Large occupies, and how well it can fit through gaps and units.
            When moving a Large Unit (or larger), count the number of meters it moved from the center of its starting space to the center of its end space.

            In some situations, Medium or Smaller Units might be able to fit through some squares of a certain Large or Large Unit (with QM's permission). For them, those squares count as Hard Terrain.

            Hitting only one space of a Large or larger Unit with an Area Ability is perfectly valid (has no special penalties, deals full Damage as if it hit fully, etc).
        - Carrying Units: |
            A Unit carrying another Unit is Slowed (and might not be able to use its hands, depending on the situation).

        - Mounted Combat: |
            Mounting or dismounting an Ally can be done normally with your Movement, by moving on its space, but that ends your Movement (unless you can Break your Movement; see rules for Breaking Movement).
            Mounts generally act on your turn and have their own movement.
            A mounted Unit is Slowed, unless it specifically states that it's ridable.

            If you want to mount an Enemy (e.g. a non-willing Unit), you must grapple it successfully with one Action - your Dexterity or Might Check versus its Dexterity of Might Check (you must match or get a higher number). If you succeed, you become mounted to that Unit for its next turn. Apply common sense to whether a mounted Unit can attack its rider (or whether the rider has Cover).


    - Damage & Status:
        - Attack: |
            An Attack is something that deals Damage or Crowd Control, coming directly from a Unit through a missile, weapon or direct Spell. Delayed Damage sources are not considered Attacks.
            Flamebolt is an attack. Magic Missile counts as multiple attacks. Curse of Pain's Damage is not an attack.
            The term "Attack" is relevant for some Abilities.
            The term "attack" is also sometimes used to simply refer to the Act of hitting or striking a Unit (e.g. making a melee attack). A "weapon attack" is simply the Act of attacking with a weapon.
        - Damage and Types: |
            Damage is a word for how many Health Points an attack or effect will reduce. Dealing 3 Damage to a Unit with 10 Health will leave the Unit at 7 Health. Upon reaching 0 or less Health, a Unit dies or Falls (see Death and being Fallen).
            There are multiple "types" of Damage, but this is just a classification for certain Abilities, and usually 3 Damage is 3 Damage, no matter the type.
            The Damage types are Slash, Smash, Pierce, Pulse (e.g. pressure, being flung around, etc), Fire, Cold, Shock, Scourge, Divine, Psychic, and True.
            There are Passive Abilities ("Resistances") that reduce certain Damage types you take by 50%, or increase it by 50% ("Weaknesses").
            True Damage that can't be reduced by any means and is not reduced by Shielding (ignores Shielding).

            The order in which Damage is added or subtracted from an Attack is:
            1. Calculate all simple (non-percentage) penalties and additions (e.g. Fumbling, range penalty, Cover, etc).
            2. Calculate all percentage penalties or additions (e.g. Weakness, Resistance, other magical buffs, etc).
            3. Calculate Defense
            
            For example, let's say you Attack a Unit with a Handgun for 1d8 Damage and you roll 7. The enemy has 1 Defense, 50% Weakness to Pierce Damage, Cover, and you are using special Bullets that deal +1 Damage.
            The Damage becomes:
            1. 7 + 1 (from Bullets) - 2 (from Cover) = 6
            2. 6 + 50% of 6 (from Weakness) = 9
            3. 9 - 1 (from Defense) = 8
            The final Damage from the Attack is 8.
        - Range: |
            To calculate the range from a Unit to another Unit, simply measure the distance from that Unit's space's center to the other Unit's space's center.
            If one of the Units is Large or larger, measure the distance from one of its outer-most spaces to the one of the other Unit's outer-most spaces (e.g. for Large Units - NOT to center, but to edge).

            An easy way to measure this, if you're playing on a grid, is to count the number of squares from one Unit to another. If the other Unit is in a square right next to his Unit (even diagonally), the distance is 1 meter. If there's an empty square between them, the distance is 2. And so on.
        - Defense: |
            If a Unit has Defense, all Damage it takes is reduced by that amount (after ALL other calculations like bonuses, penalties, resistances, etc).
        - Shielding: |
            Shielding is just extra "Health" on top of your normal Health. Shielding can exceed your Max Health. For example, if you have 20 Health and 5 Shielding, and you take 9 Damage, you will be left with 16 Health.
            Generally, Shielding last for a short time, then whatever is left of the Shielding disappears. For example, if you gain 10 Shielding which lasts for 1 minute, and you take 5 Damage, you will have 5 Shielding remaining. After 1 minute, the Shielding expires and you will have 0 Shielding.
            Shielding can stack (e.g. from 2 Abilities). For example, if you use an Ability that gives you 10 Shielding and then use another Ability that gives you 5 Shielding, you wll have 15 Shielding.
            However, when one of the Shielding disappears, it tries to disappear for the full amount - if you gained 10 Shielding, you lose 10 Shielding when it expires. For example, if you gain 10 Shielding for an hour and 5 Shielding for 1 minute, then you take 8 Damage, this leaves you at 7 Shielding. Then, after 1 minute, the 5 Shielding disappears and leaves you at 2 Shielding.
            As another example, if you gain 5 Shielding for an hour and 10 Shielding for 1 minute, then you take 8 Damage, this leaves you at 7 Shielding; when the 10 Shielding expires, you will be left at 0 Shielding.
            Simply put: if you gain Shielding and the Shielding expires, you lose as much Shielding as you gained. There is no "priority" for Shielding absorption - Shielding is Shielding. What you gain is what you lose when it expires.
            You never lose Health when Shielding expires.
        - Resistance and Weakness (50%): |
            Resistance to a certain Damage type means you only take 50% of that Damage (of the final Damage you take; e.g. after subtracting Defense).
            Weakness to a certain Damage type means you take 150% of that Damage (of the final Damage you take; e.g. after subtracting Defense).
            If you have both Resistance and Weakness to something, they cancel out (so you take 100% of the Damage, as normal).
            If you have Resistance or Weakness twice, nothing extra happens (e.g. even if you have 2 Resistance and one Weakness to the same thing, you still take 100% Damage).
        - Death: |
            Reducing a non-player character to 0 Health kills it immediately, unless the attacker purposefully stated that the Attack should be non-lethal. When a player character reaches 0 Health, it doesn't die, but becomes Fallen.
        - Being Fallen (0 Health): |
            When reaching 0 Health, a Player Character becomes Fallen.
            When Fallen, you skip your turn. You are not unconscious - you can still speak, see and hear, but you can not move your body.
            You can not have less than 0 Health.

            When healed while Fallen, you get up and can do your turn, but you are Exhausted until the end of Combat.
            
            While Fallen, your Defense is 0, and if you take Damage 5 times, your character dies.
            Then, if you are healed and get up from being Fallen, these "times" you can take Damage reset (e.g. even if you took Damage 2 times, if you get up and then Fall again, you still need to take the Damage 5 times to die).

            Alternatively, if the Quest Master decides to make the game extra risky and more deadly, the QM can rule that these Damage times carry on until the next Adventure.
        - Rise: |
            When a Fallen Player Character (with 0 Health, but not dead) is healed, it Rises. It can continue to take its turns, but is Exhausted indefinitely.

        - Exhaustion: |
            An Exhausted Unit is Dazed and Slowed indefinitely: it has only a Half-Action every turn and -2 Movement Speed.
            
            Exhaustion does NOT last just 1 turn - Exhaustion from being Fallen is automatically cured 10 minutes after the end of the combat encounter.
            Otherwise, Exhaustion is cured upon sleeping for 8 hours.
            
            You can also become Exhausted if you go more than 24 hours without sleep, from overdosing on potions (e.g. if you drink more than 1 potion per hour) or from magical effects.

            Since you are already Dazed and Slowed, being Dazed or Slowed again has no effect.
        - Melee vs Ranged: |
            Abilities usually specify if an attack is considered melee or ranged.
            If it is not specified, then any attack with a melee weapon that is not thrown is considered a melee attack, even if it has longer range (e.g. 2 meters or 3 meters even).
            Also, any attack with an Ability is considered melee if it has a range of 1 meter, otherwise it is considered a ranged attack. If it has a range of 2 more meters (thus is a ranged attack), the attack is still considered ranged even if done at very close range (e.g. 1 meter).
            In any other cases, if the the range is 1 meter, or the object is not thrown, but has a longer range than 1 meter, it is considered a melee attack.

            Ranged attacks done at 1 meter range have a -2 penalty, even if they are Spells.
        - Line of Sight: |
            If you can see a Unit directly, you have Line of Sight to it.
            
            To clarify, if Unit A can see Unit B with their bare eyes, then Unit A has Line of Sight to Unit B.
            If Unit A can see even a little bit of the body of Unit B, then Unit A still has Line of Sight to Unit B (but attacks usually gain the Cover pentalty, which is -2).
            
            To use an Ability, you need Line of Sight to the center target point of where you are casting the Ability.
            
            If playing on a grid, if you have to target a point, you target the square that point is in. You can't normally target square intersections unless the Ability states you can.
            If you target a Unit, you must have Line of Sight to its square.
            
            There is Line of Sight from square A to square B if you can draw a line from any corner of square A to any corner of square B without any other Unit or Obstacle crossing the line.
            However, other Units' or obstacles' squares can _intersect_ the line you were drawing if it's merely tangential, and does not pass from one side of the line to the other.
            See the example below.
            
            Without magical means, Line of Sight is always 2-way. If Unit A has LoS to Unit B, then Unit B also has LoS to Unit A (assuming they look at one another).
            Transparent solid objects (e.g. windows) do not block Line of Sight, but obviously missiles like arrows and magic bolts can't go through them. Apply common sense.

            Allies do not block Line of Sight, and neither do Enemies, but attacking a target behind another Unit provides them with Cover against the attack.
        - Cover: |
            An Act (attack, Spell, etc) has Cover if done "through" or over an obstacle or Unit, or Line of Sight is somewhat obstructed (fog, water, etc).
            Cover reduces the total roll (or Damage, or Healing, etc) by 50%.
            Whether something has Cover is up to the Quest Master's interpretation. It is possible that a Unit has Cover from another Unit, but not necessarily viceversa (e.g. if shooting from behind a rock).
    # If the path from a Unit to another Unit is somewhat obstructed (e.g. by obstacles or other enemy Units), then the Unit targeted has Cover.
    # The -2 Damage from the Cover is subtracted first thing from the Damage (e.g. before Resistances, Weaknesses, etc).

        - Distace: |
            When calculating distance from point A to point B, calculate the distance from the square A is on to the square B is on like this:
            Start from a square near A and count squares one by one (in a line or diagonally) until you get to B. You also count the square B is on for this.    
            Remember this by thinking that if A is on the corner of B, that's a distance of 1 meter.            
        - Area: |
            For Abilities that affect areas, the distance is calculated to the edge square of the area.
            E.g. for a 4x4 meter area, if the range is 6 meters, there should be a path of 5 empty squares between the caster and the area.

            If a spell targets a line, it starts from a square right in front of you and continues in a line.
            E.g. if the line is 2 meters long, it takes the square in front of you, and the next one.

            All 90 degree Cones are considered squares, unless the Quest Master rules it otherwise. As such, all Cones obey the normal area effects and distances, made from 1 meter range at most.
            The Quest Master might allow for more "cheeky" cone positioning, but it will most likely apply the Semi-Hitting Penalty.
        - Semi-Hitting (Area Abilities): |
            When playing on a grid, you might sometimes position an area Ability in such way that it somewhat hits certain Units, hits half of their Spaces, or is in an awkward shape.
            A fair warning: it is not recommended that you allow awkward area positions on the board.

            Semi-Hitting deals -2 Damage and Semi-Hit Units gain +2 to Checks made from it.
            For example, you could position a 3x3 meter area in the center of a 4x4 meter area; thus, the 4 squares in the middle will be fully covered by the 3x3 area, but the surrounding squares will all only be covered by a half of a square from the 3x3 area (or even a quarter).

            Note: a Large Unit takes the full effect even if only one space (1x1 meter) of its total area is hit (e.g. hitting only a square of the 4 squares of a Large Unit applies the normal effect - it is NOT a Semi-Hit).
        - Near (Nearness): |
            'Near' refers to all spaces within 1 meter of a Unit.
        - Falling Damage: |
            Falling inflicts 1d6 True Damage for every 2 meters fallen (assuming you land on hard ground).
            E.g. falling 3 meters deals 1d6 Damage, falling 4 meters deals 2d6 Damage, 5 meters - 2d6, 6 meters - 3d6, etc.
            Having someone fall on you deals the same True Damage to you as it does to the faller.
            The Quest Master might reduce the Damage or mitigate it depending what you land on or if you fall onto an enemy with an attack. If you're a Quest Master, consider halving the fall Damage if a Unit falls intentionately on another Unit to attack it.
        - Combat & Resist Checks: |
            Some Abilities require you to make a "Check against something". To succeed, you need to roll a Check equal to or higher than the number you're rolling against. These are called Combat Checks. If you're battling against another Check, you need to roll higher than the enemy Check.
            Some monster Abilities will have you make a Resist Check. These are just like normal Checks or Combat Checks. As usual, you must roll equal to or higher than the number you're rolling against in order to succeed.

    - Crowd Control:
        - Crowd Control standards: |
            A "Crowd Control" effect is a status effect on a Unit that prevents it from doing things normally (e.g. it can't move, it can't make Actions, can't take its turn, etc).
            All Crowd Control lasts until the end of that Unit's next Turn (or until the end of their current Turn if it's their Turn now), unless stated otherwise.
            Crowd Controls of different types stack together (e.g. a Unit that is both Fumbling and Blinded will have both -2 and -50% to all Attacks).
            Crowd Controls of the same types do NOT stack (e.g. if you make a Unit Fumbling 2 times, it will still be Fumbling as normal for just 1 turn, even if it is an Epic monster).
        - Slowed: A Slowed Unit has -2 Maximum Movement Speed.
        - Rooted: A Rooted Unit can't willingly Move from its place on its turn except with Abilities (e.g. being pushed, teleporting, etc). It's Actions are unaffected.
        - Dazed: |
            A Dazed Player Character only has a Half-Action on its turn.
            A Dazed NPC makes one less non-movement Act (e.g. a Koblod can only make 1 attack instead of 2, a Morloc must choose between using its Net or its standard attack, a monster with only 1 attack can't attack, etc).
        - Stunned: |
            A Stunned Unit must skip its turn.
        - Fumbling: |
            A Fumbling Unit has -2 to all Damage it deals.
        - Blinded: |
            A Blinded Unit deals 50% less Damage and Healing and all of its Checks are halved.
        - Silenced: |
            A Silenced Unit can't use any Abilities (but it can use weapons, magic items, etc).
            Passive Abilities are not affected by Silence, even if magical by nature. If a Spell would be "triggered" and the caster is Silenced, the Spell can't trigger.
        - Crippled: |
            A Crippled Unit deals 100% less Damage.
            Note that percentages stack additively. For example, if you are Crippled but you get an extra 50% Damage from whatever source, you will deal only 50% reduced Damage (-100% + 50% = -50%).
        - Charm: |
            A Charmed Unit can't run (move) away from the Charmer and can't directly target the Charmer with attacks or Abilities (but can use Area of Effect Abilities on it).
            Moving away means increasing the distance between you and the Charmer. The Charmed Unit can push itself away, teleport away, etc.
        - Feared: |
            A Feared Unit can only do 1 Act per turn (e.g. moving, attacking, casting one Spell, etc).
        - Exhausted: |
            An Exhausted Unit is Dazed and Slowed indefinitely: it has only a Half-Action every turn and -2 Movement Speed.
            
            Exhaustion does NOT last just 1 turn - Exhaustion from being Fallen is automatically cured 10 minutes after the end of the combat encounter.
            Otherwise, Exhaustion is cured upon sleeping for 8 hours.
            
            You can also become Exhausted if you go more than 24 hours without sleep, from overdosing on potions (e.g. if you drink more than 1 potion per hour) or from magical effects.

            Since you are already Dazed and Slowed, being Dazed or Slowed again has no effect.
        - Other Interactions: |
            If a Unit gets Crowd Controlled while doing an Act (e.g. you activate a trap while shooting a bow), what happens depends on the Crowd Control type.
            If Pushed, the Unit is Pushed immediately (and dashes are cancelled). If the Act was not started yet (e.g. not yet attacked), then the Unit is free to do something else after being Pushed if they want to. However, if the Act already started (e.g. fired 1 out of 3 Magic Missiles), the Unit must continue casting the Spell, on the same target if it was already chosen, only if it's still valid (e.g. has Line of Sight or Range). If the Act can't be continued due to Range, Line of Sight, etc, then the rest of the Act is cancelled; Actions/Resoureces are NOT regained and are lost.
            Cripple, Daze, Slow: Nothing happens on the spot; the Crowd Control takes effect after the Ability finishes.
            Silence: If it's a Spell, the rest of the Spell gets cancelled; otherwise nothing else happens.
            Stun and other non-listed strong CC: The Ability gets cancelled.
            Fear, Charm: The Unit must retract its Act if it was on the Fearer/Charmer; then, it must move. Then, it can resume its turn and use that same Action or another one as it pleases, now or later in the turn (the Unit does not lose its Action).
            Becoming Slowed on your turn immediately reduces your remaining Speed by 2 (but not less than 0, obviously).

    - Weapons and Armor:
        - Weapons: |
            TODO
        - Armor: |
            TODO                            # Amror does not require training
        - Weapon Training (and Shields): |       # Why are Shields considered...
            Every Class gives you Training in at least one weapon category. The categories are 1-Handed Melee, 2-Handed Melee, 1-Handed Ranged, 2-Handed Ranged, Throwing Weapons and Shields.
            If you are trained in 1-Handed Melee weapons, it means you are Trained in Shortswords, Daggers, Punches, etc - anything that is 1-Handed.

            If you have Training in a weapon, you can attack with that weapon normally (roll weapon Damage and add the Stat the weapon uses, usually Might or Dexterity).
            If you attack with a weapon you are not Trained in, it's just an Improvised Attack from Default Moves (at close range, it deals 1d4 + Might Damage; at up to 6 meters range, it deals 1d4 + Dexterity Damage).

            Some Abilities might give you Training in specific weapons (e.g. Guns) without giving you Training in the weapon category, though this is a rare occurance.
        - Throwing weapons: |
            If you want to throw a weapon that's not baseline made for throwing, it is considered an Improvised Attack (there's a Default Move Basic Ability called Improvised Attack).
            There exists a Feat called Throwing Expert that allows you to throw weapons with their normal Damage.
            You still need to be Trained in that weapon to throw it without it being an Improvised Attack.
        - How to get Training: |
            Most Classes give you free Training in various weapons or weapon types.
            You can get Training in any weapon category by getting the Weapon Training Feat (see Feats).
            Finally, you can get Training in any weapon by spending one Inspiration Point (see Inspiration).

        - Swapping Weapons: |
            At the start of your turn, you can freely choose what weapons to use or swap for the rest of your turn.
            For example, when your turn starts, you can choose to prepare one Shortsword and a Shield, or a Greatclub, or a Hand Crossbow and a Dagger.
            You can use these weapons however you like on your turn.
            If you ever want to swap weapons in the middle of your turn, you must spend a Half-Action.

            Changing weapons at the start of your turn is encouraged! Use different weapons to your advantage!

        - Weapon Ranges: |
            Ranged weapons have a range specified. You can attack normally if you are within that range.
            If you attack from more than the weapon's range, the attack has a -2 penalty.
            If you attack from more than double the weapon's range, the attack has a -4 penalty.
            You can't attack further than that.

        - Aiming: |
            You can not aim for a specific area when attacking of using an Ability.
            However, in niche cases, the QM might allow the use of the Aim Ability to aim at a specific point on the target (with consequences decided by the QM).


    - Abilities:
        - Abilities explained: |
            An Ability is simply a block of text that either gives you some thing extra (passively) or gives you something else to do with your Actions rather than attacking.
            Every Race and Class gives you some special Abilities. You will know you have these Abilities if they are written on your character sheet.
            If you are a Gnome, you have some extra Abilities that Elves don't have.
            
            Let's take a look at exactly what Abilities you start with as a Gnome!
            
            First off, you have Inherited Tastes. You can see it's a Passive Ability, meaning you don't need to use it manually; it's always there, in the back of your mind. It's like an extra trait for your character.
            Inherited Tastes is very simple. You don't have a sense of taste, but your eyes perceive colors sharper than most. Doesn't sound like much, but it is an Ability!
            
            Then, let's look at Lucky Presence. This one is an Ability that you can actually use!
            After someone else makes a Check, you can say "I use Lucky Presence" and they must roll the check again. Presumably, you would use this on your allies when they fail a Check, or on your enemies when they succeed a Check you would've liked them to fail.
            There are 2 interesting things about this Ability: the first one is that it's a "Reaction". Reaction is another type of Action that you can only do on others' turns. You can't do just anything with Reactions. Every Reaction is usually an Ability that has a specific time when you can use it. In this case, you must use Lucky Presence when someone makes a Check.
            The second thing to look at is the hourglass icon near which it says "Long Rest". This is called a Cooldown and it tells you how long you have to wait before you can use this Ability again after you use it once. If it has a Cooldown of Long Rest, that means you can use it once, and then you must finish a Long Rest before you can use it again.
            
            That's all the Abilities Gnomes start with! Let's take a look at another Ability now, to see another example. We'll look at the Spell called Bonfire.
            Bonfire is a magical Spell, and it is only available to spell casters, like Mages and Shamans. When you cast this, you choose 1-cubic-meter area where a bonfire is conjured, and it deals Damage! The Aability text itself is self explanatory and straight-forward.
            Bonfire takes 1 Action to do. So, on your turn, you'd have to choose between attacking and casting Bonfire. Reminder that 1 Action is the same as 2 Half-Actions. So if you cast Bonfire, you can not do anything else with your hands this turn! And if you use one hand for a Half-Action, you can't cast Bonfire; because you are left with a Half-Action, and Bonfire takes 1 whole Action.
            The last thing to notice about Bonfire is the arrow-and-target icon where it says "6 meters". This simply means the spell Bonfire has a maximum range of 6 meters. The space you choose to cast Bonfire on must be within 6 meters of you (and you must be able to see the location, of course).

            One quick way to differentiate Passive from Active Abilities is that Active Abilities have a square icon, while Passive Abilities have a round icon!

            Let's look into an Ability that's a little more _Advanced_, Healing Surge.
            The text is very short and straight-forward - you restore 2d6 Health to a Unit. 
            The "Half-Action" and "5 meters" tags should also be self explanatory for you by now.
            The "1 Mana" text refers to the cost of this Ability. The next section will explain Spellcasting.
        
        - Ability notes: |
            Generally, you will have to find a way to keep track of your Abilities. Sure, you can just write down the name of each Ability you have, but then you'd have to search it online every time you want to do something. The easiest way to keep track is with the Ability Sheet Generator, which can be found at this link.

        - Ability Tags: |
            Cooldown, Duration, etc.
        - Cooldown: |
            Some Abilities have a Cooldown.
            Cooldown refers to the time you must wait to use the Ability again.
            An Ability's Cooldown is represented by the _white hourglass_ icon. If an Ability has no such icon, then it has no Cooldown and can be used as often as you like.
            A Cooldown of "Once / Adventure" means you can use the Ability ONCE, and then can't use it again until you finish the current Adventure.
            A Cooldown mentioning time (e.g. 1 hour, 1 day, etc) always refers to in-game time, not real-life time. 1 day in game can pass instantly, if the Quest Master says "one day passes", for example. Like in a book, movie or video game, time in-game passes from scene to scene, according to the adventure story.
        - Duration: |
            Duration on Abilities is usually self-explanatory.
        - Abiliy Requirements: |
            TODO
        - Triggering Abilities: |
            Some Abilities give you free uses of other Abilities. For example, Clerics get to cast Awe for free, even if it's on a Cooldown.
            When an Ability tells you that you can "freely cast X ignoring its Cooldown/Cost", you can cast that Ability in that moment, whether it's on Cooldown or not.
            If it's not on Cooldown, the Ability does NOT go on Cooldown if you trigger a free cast like this.
            If it's on Cooldown, the Ability remains on Cooldown.
        - The Rule of Procs: |
            Some Abilities have effects that happen randomly, at the roll of a die, or apply generally. In gaming, the moment such an effect happens is usually called a "proc".
            To keep the game fast, it is recommended a player is responsible for calling out procs, percentages increases or decreases, etc. If a "proc" happens but nobody notices it, it is recommended that it does not apply if they remember about it too late.
        - Spells: |
            A Spell is an Ability made with magic.
            All Spells are Abilities, but only some Abilities are Spells. This only matters in certain niche scenarios.
        - Mana: |
            All Classes in the game use a system of points called Mana Points.
            You have a number of Mana Points that you can spend to cast some Spells, and you regain all Mana Points back when you start a new Adventure.
            
            The amount of Mana a Spell costs to cast is represented by the _blue flame_ icon and the number near it.
            
            For a clear example, let's take a look at the Mage Class. As written on the Mage rules page, Mages start with 3 Mana Points (and get 1 more total Mana every Level). Every Adventure, the Mage can choose to spend these points on casting Spells.
            Each Spell specifies if and how many Mana Points it costs to cast. If you decide to cast Healing Surge, you must expend one Mana Point and then you are left with 2 Mana Points. It doesn't specify that Healing Surge has a Cooldown, so you can do it even twice per turn (since it takes a Half-Action) as long as you have enough Mana Points. If you don't have enough Mana Points to cast a Spell, you simply can't.
            
            When building your character, you will have to choose a number of Basic Abilities from the ones available to your class (e.g. Ability Schools, like Elemental, Divine, Warfare, etc) - you can't have them all, there are dozens in the game! You'll pick a few Spells to have at hand. Mages, for example, start out with 4 + your Intelligence Basic Abilities. So, if your Intelligence is 3, you must pick 7 Abilities (total) from the Elemental and/or Arcane Lists. These will be all the Basic Spells you will be able to use until you finish the current Adventure.
            You pick these Abilities aside from your Class Abilities (e.g. Magic Mastery does not count among the 7).
            Check our your Class's available Ability Lists by going to your Class's page, at Spell Casting, under Basic Ability Lists. All Basic Abilities are on the Abilities page.
            This is explained in further detail later on (see Basic Ability Lists).
            
            You can keep track of your Mana Points on a sheet of paper, with marbles, dice, etc. It is your job to keep track of your Mana Points. Don't cheat!

        - Basic Ability: |
            A Basic Ability refers to an Ability from the Basic Ability Lists (see Basic Ability Lists).
            They are called Basic because multiple Classes have access to them.

        - Known Basic Abilities: |
            Your Known Basic Abilities are very straightforward.
            Your character can have that many Known Basic Abilities.
            You look at the Basic Ability Lists your class has access to (e.g. Clerics have access to the Warfare and Divine Basic Ability Lists).
            From all those Basic Abilities, you pick multiple of them and you have them at a ready. Some of those Spells will cost Mana to use, some not.
            
            If a Spell displays a blue flame icon and a number, then it costs that much Mana to cast it.
            
            These spells represent what your Character has prepared for adventuring. They function exactly like Abilities you have. Inbetween Adventures, you can change what Spells from these Basic Ability Lists your Character knows.
            
        - Basic Ability Lists: |
            Aside from the Abilities you get from your Race and Class, there are also some Basic Ability Lists you have access to.
            Classes have access to different Basic Ability Lists and can have a number of Basic Abilities chosen from them.
            
            A Basic Ability List is simply a list of Basic Abilities. A set of Basic Abilities grouped together based on their theme and category is called a Basic Ability List (themes like Elemental, Nature, Divine, etc).
            The text for every Ability is also in that list. Take a look at this page to familiarize yourself with them.
            
            As of 2023, there are 10 Basic Ability Lists in the game: Bloodshed, Warfare, Elemental, Arcane, Nature, Mysticism, Faith, Eldritch and Divine. Clerics, for example, have access to the Warfare and Divine Basic Ability Lists.
            Also, Clerics can have 4 + their Intelligence Basic Abilities from these lists (Warfare and Divine).
            Clerics have access to the Warfare and Divine Basic Ability Lists.
            This means that if you are a Cleric (and let's say your Intelligence is 2), you can pick 6 Spells from _any_ of those 3 Basic Ability Lists and have them at a ready. Some of those Spells will cost Mana to use, some not.

        - Relearning Abilities (Unlearning): |
            All Classes can unlearn and re-learn their Basic Abilities inbetween Adventures.
            Talents can also be swapped inbetween Adventures (see Respeccing).

        - Feats: |
            There exist a set of extra Abilities called Feats (which you can find on the {Feats} page). These usually change how you play your character or give you some extra interesting options, but always have a cost attached (usually in Max Health, Mana, Initiative, etc).
            You can get as many of these as you can afford.
            Feats are optional, and you're not necessarily missing out if you decide to play without Feats.

        - Feat Costs: |
            If you can't afford to get a Feat (e.g. don't have enough Max Mana to sacrifice), you can't get the Feat.
        
        - Somatic, Verbal, Material: No such thing. Spells just require Actions, Mana, etc. As long as your hands are free and are not Silenced, you can cast Spells.
        - Spell Components: |
            Some Spells require a component. Components are consumed upon casting.
        - Keeping track of your Abilities: |
            You can keep track of what Abilities you have (e.g. their names) in the Description section of the Character Sheet, on the right.
            There is also a page called Ability Sheet Maker (under Learn, Resources for Learning). You can use that app to add your Abilities, then click on Generate to see all your Abilities in a single place. You can take a screenshot of these or right click and save the images as PNG's. The list you made should remain saved on your browser, but this is not guaranteed to work.



    - Character Advancement:
        - Leveling Up: By Experience or milestone.
        - Talents: |
            From Level 3, every 2 Levels (3, 5, 7, 9), you gain a Talent from your Class Specialization.
            Every 2 Levels, you have to pick exactly one from the options at exactly that Level. For example, at Level 5, you can NOT pick one more Talent from Level 2.
        - Relearning/Unlearning/Respeccing: |
            All Classes can unlearn and re-learn their Basic Abilities inbetween Adventures.
            Talents can also be swapped inbetween Adventures (see Respeccing).
            
            Inbetween Adventures, Player Characters can "respec their Talents", meaning they can change their Talent Choices (from Levels 3, 5, 7 and 9).
            For example, you can unlearn a Level 3 Talent and get a different one instead (from the same Specialization).
            When unlearning a Talent, the Player Character removes all benefits that Talent gave. For example, a Berserker Shaman who unlearns Primal Trophy loses all the extra Health they got from that Talent, as well as all Skills from the trophies. If a Talent offers extra Abilities (e.g. Strangevolution Level 5 Talent from Druid, Coven of the Wild, which gives 2 Racial Abilities), the Player Character loses those Abilities as well.
            When relearning a Talent, the Player Character regains all benefits that Talent gave previously, with the exact same choices and numbers. For example, Primal Trophy will once again give the Health and Skills (as well as remembering how many trophies the character had), and Strangevolution will give back the same 2 Racial Abilities.
            Character Stats, Specializations and Feats generally can't be changed, unless the QM allows for this in special circumstances, with things such as a Tome of Unlearning item or undergoing intensive training for a period of time, to retrain the character's capabilities.

        - Gaining Experience: |
            TODO
        - Inspiration Points: |
            In Questguard, the Quest Master can give a player an Inspiration Point for a cool idea, outstanding roleplaying or strategies or, honestly, whatever the Quest Master wants to give Inspiration Points for.
            Generally, you can earn an Inspiration Point for impressing the Quest Master or contributing well to the game. It's up to each Quest Master to decide what impresses them and when to award an Inspiration Point.
            Inspiration Points are awarded individually. We recommend that the Quest Master awards 1 to 2 Inspiration Points (total, not per player) every session.

            Inspiration Points can be spent to improve your character or influence the tide of roleplaying.
            You can spend one Inspiration Point to gain Training in any one Weapon Type (Shortswords, Rapiers, Shields, etc) or gain one Skill from the Skills list.
            You can spend an Inspiration Point to also increase your Max Health by 1.
            Finally, you can also spend one Inspiration Point to nudge a situation slightly in your favor or influence the outcome of a roleplaying situation. This is up to your creativity. For example, if the QM says you can't find a Blacksmith in a town, you could say "I want to use my Inspiration to actually find a Blacksmith". Or, for another example, if you fall down a ravine, you could say "I want to use my Inspiration to have remembered to tie a rope to myself before crossing this ravine". So, in theory, you could alter the past and the present. Use your creativity!
            However, remember that the QM can refuse to allow you to use Inspiration in a way. Inspiration is meant to nudge the outcomes slightly, not alter whole timelines or create large-scale modifications to the present. Always ask the QM if you are allowed to use Inspiration this way.


    - Items:
        - Items (using items): |
            Most items you can use in combat take a Half-Action to make (e.g. Scrolls, Potions, Caltrops, etc).
            Even if a Spell normally takes 0 Actions, the scroll still takes a Half-Action to use. For example, if you have a Scroll of Smite, you must first land a weapon attack, then use the scroll to add the extra Damage (just like Smite says, but with a Half-Action).
            There might be situations in which using a Scroll is not feasible.
        - Potions: |
            Consuming a Potion takes a Half-Action.
            
            Every Unit can safely use at most one "Potion" per in-game hour. If a brew restores Health, Mana, Movement, etc (e.g. is not a lasting buff), it counts as a "Potion". Magical foods with similar properties count as Potions. The Quest Master can choose to rule something as "not a Potion", which means it can be safely consumed, as per the item's rules.    
            The second Potion consumed per hour makes the Unit suffer of Exhaustion for 1 hour.
            The third and all further Potions consumed per hour make the user pass a Grade 12 Might Check or fall to 0 Health and fall in a coma (Unconscious) for 1 hour.
        - Scrolls: |
            A scroll is usually a piece of parchment that has a Spell infused in it. When used, the Scroll releases that Spell and the scroll destroyed. Scrolls are one-time use items.
            Using a Scroll takes a Half-Action.
            You don't need to be a spellcaster to use a Scroll, or expend Mana. Scrolls ignore cooldowns on your Abilities - they have nothing to do with your own Ability Cooldowns or Costs.
            
            When using a scroll, you use your own Stats for that Spell (e.g. your Intelligence, your Sense, etc).
            The scroll Spell does not benefit from effect bonuses increased by your character's Levels or by Talents. It is simply a plain copy of a Spell.
            
            As a Quest Master, be careful with how you allow Players to buy scrolls from Shops. Players should not be able to buy all the scrolls they need and stock up on, say, 6 Fireball Scrolls they can just use on a whim.

        - Magic Items: |
            No soulbound or attunement.

    - Non-Combat and Time:
        - Checks: |
            Whenever a Unit wants to do something that's not guaranteed to succeed (e.g. jumping over a chasm), the Unit rolls 1d12 and adds one fitting Stat (Might, Dexterity, Intelligence, Sense or Charisma). Generaly, the Quest Master will call out for a Unit to roll a Check to determine whether they succeed at it.
            If the Unit is Skilled at that specific non-combat activity, they can also add their Level. Non-player characters can't normally be Skilled in anything. The Quest Master might have an NPC be Skilled at something and provide themselves a bonus for it, of their choice.
        - Repeating Checks: |    
            Intelligence and Sense Checks normally can't be repeated - if one fails an Intelligence or Sense Check, then they simply don't know, aren't able to comprehend it no matter how hard they try, or can't sense what they're supposed to.
            Might Checks normally can't be repeated unless the character tries a different approach (up to the Quest Master's interpretation).
            Dexterity and Charisma Checks may sometimes be repeated, but, normally, the failure is more disrupting.
        - Leading Checks and Helping: |
            If multiple players want to make the same Check (e.g. inspecting for traps, remembering informatio, etc), determine (the Quest Master or the players) which player character is the most qualified for it.
            Only the most qualified character rolls the Check.
            Other characters may try to roll a Helping Check, to help the character rolling the main Check.
        - Helping Check: |
            When attempting to help someone else, a character can roll a Helping Check, and add the result to the main roller's Check.
            A Helping Check is equal to a normal Check - 10 (can add the Stat and non-combat Skill).
            Helping must be decided before the most qualified character makes the roll and helping takes 1 minute.
            
            For example, let's assume the most qualified character rolls a main Intelligence Check for a total of 1d12 + 5, and another character decides to roll a Helping Check for a total of 1d12 + 1.
            If the main Intelligence Check resulted in 11 (e.g. 6 + 5), and the Helping Check resulted in -2 (7 + 1 - 10), then the final result of the main Check is 9.
        - Adventure System: |
            An Adventure is a period of gameplay defined by the QM. An Adventure could be one full dungeon, one quest, one session, or just one day outdoors adventuring.
            Player Characters regain all resources (Health, Mana, Cooldowns, etc) at the end of an Adventure (inbetween Adventures).

            For combat purposes, it is recommended that an Adventure contain 3 Medium-difficulty combats (or 2 difficult ones). Combat difficulty is calculated by the Quest Master via total Monster Experience (see Monsters).

            Characters can also "respec" inbetween Adventures - can choose different Talents and Known Abilities.
            There is no concept of "long resting" in Questguard - you only regain spent resources inbetween Adventures.
        - Quest System: |
            The Quest System is an alterntive to the Adventure System (tentative).

            A completed Quest (or Sidequest) is a milestone for the players. When the players reach that milestone in the story (complete a Quest), they regain all resources. In short:
            Players regain all resources upon completing a Quest. Players heal for an amount equal to their Health Regen when completing a Sidequest.
            The Quest Master decides what a Completed Quest or Sidequest is - it could be the end of a dungeon, saving someone, or finishing the game session.

            For combat purposes, it is recommended that a Quest contain a total of 3 Medium-difficulty combats (or 2 difficult ones), assuming no Sidequests. Combat difficulty is calculated by the Quest Master via total Monster Experience (see Monsters).

            Players can relearn Abilities and Talents after completing a Quest.
            A Quest may or may not have a clearly defined start or end.
            As a QM, feel free to say a Quest is complete whenever you feel the players need to recover their resources. If the players ask "Was this a quest?" you have the option to say "It was a Sidequest".
        # Reserve Health is, well, Health that you have in reserves. When not in combat, you can instantly transfer Health from your Reserve Health to your regular Health (e.g. take points from your Reserve Health to heal your Health for the same amount).
        # Healing from your Reserve Health can only be done 10 minutes after a combat encounter ends.

        - Combat Grace Period: |
            For 10 minutes after finishing a combat encounter, all Units who participated are still considered in combat.
            Some Abilities and game mechanics (e.g. Health Regen) require you to be out of combat to use.
            Be on your toes for a while after finishing a fight!
