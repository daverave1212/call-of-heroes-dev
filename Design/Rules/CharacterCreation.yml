Character Creation: 
    Welcome To Character Creation!: |
        In a tabletop roleplaying game like Call of Heroes, a Game Master player creates a story, and hero players play as characters inside that story! If you want to be a hero inside another Game Master's adventure, you need to create your hero, called a Character!
        Before you even create a Character, you should talk to the GM about what kind of character fits inside their story.
    What Makes A Character?: |
        Every character is a combination of a Race, a Class and, of course, a personality, look and backstory. These all should be taken into consideration when creating your character in relation to the story you're taking part in.
        This section will go over the (now written) social rules when playing the game with a group of people.
        For a GM's story, you will create your character to your likings; however, you should try to be aware of the social etiquette, explained in the following points.
    How Do I Come Up With A Character Idea?: |
        What sounds cool
        Race/class/background for inspiration
        If you're just starting out, you should first think about what Class you want to play from a _coolness_ standpoint.
        Just pick what sounds the coolest to you!
        In the current version of the game, the official classes are the following.
        
        Cleric - a religious spellcaster who'snot afraid to fight; Clerics are generally solid healers (medics) and have good access to disruption against enemies (Crowd Control); Clerics are also the necromancers and shadow priests of the game. Examples of Clerics are Anduin, Lady Mellisandre, Moses, Faust from Shaman King.
        Druid - a nature spellcaster who can transform into animals; Druids are wildcards and can have the most varied playstyles, intertwining nature magic with the whimsical or dark arts. Examples of Druids are Radaghast the Brown, Malfurion, Poison Ivy.
        Hunter - a ranger or slayer of monsters, sometimes fighting alongside a trusty animal companion; Hunter are not necessarily ranged attackers and they do have access to nature Spells as well. Examples of Hunters are Legolas, Geralt from the Witcher.
        Mage - a heavy user of magic, generally more frail than most, but possessing vast knowledge and powerful spells; Mages are also artificers who can create magical artefacts, bend time, conjure elementals, transform into dragons and much, much more. Examples of Mages are Merlin, Gandalf, Lina.
        Paladin - an honorable knight who uses both physical prowess and faith-based magic; not all Paladins are good - some are cruel conquerers or zealous fanatics. Examples of Paladins are Garen and Kayle from League of Legends, Uther and Arthas, Hollow Knight.
        Rogue - a sneaky thief, asassin or ninja, great at isolating and taking out enemies; Rogues can become spellcasters too, or, if they choose so, they can be all-out swashbucklers. Examples of Rogues are Ezio or Altair, Garrett from Thief, Corvo.
        Shaman - a primal caster, using the powers of spirit, mind and body in communion; Shamans can be witch doctors, as well as heavy duty berserkers with a thirst for blood. Examples of Shamans are Wargs from Game of Thrones, Thrall, viking berserkers, Nazeebo.
        Warlock - a spellcaster who received their powers from a patron; although usually evil, Warlocks can be good and have good or chaotic patrons; Warlocks are the demon tamers and shadowblades of this world. Examples of Warlocks are Kayn and Varus, Aleister Crowley, Gul'dan.
        Warrior - a physical fighter who uses technique and force to down enemies; contrary to popular belief, not all Warriors are melee fighters or brutes. Examples of Warriors are Conan, Ser Jorah.
   
Social Etiquette:
    Fitting In - Overall Character: |
        When you play in a GM's story, it's important to consider social etiquette and respect the rules of the story.
        Although some points might seem obvious, always keep the following questions in mind and try to respect the social norms of the game you take part in.
    1. Does My Character Personality Fit?: |
        You don't want to create a Sci-Fi space marine for a story like Lord of the Rings. That would be silly and break the immersion for other players, and make the story less believable.
        Does your GM run a dark, gritty, fantasy story? Maybe a witch hunter-type character would do fine, or a dark sorcerer of some sort. Is it a very light-hearted high fantasy experience, with lots of color and dragons everywhere? Maybe something magical would do! Is the story more realistic, with less magic? Perhaps a human warrior would be the best.
        
        Do talk to your team mates about what type of character they want to create.
        Remember that tabletop roleplaying games usually put emphasis on immersion, meaning that players like to submerge themselves in the story and fantasy of the made-up world, and play it as if they live it!
        If you want to create a funny or joke character, make sure everyone is on-board with that. Don't show up at the game with a comedic, unserious character if everyone is taking it seriously.
        
        Lastly in this section, make sure your character wants to work with a team to achieve a goal. Lone wolf characters sound cool, but in practice, the best characters are the one who want to work as a team! You and your fellow players are a team! Always remember that!
    2. Do My Character Capabilities Fit?: |
        Another thing to consider is what kind of gameplay will be the most prevalent. Some GM's run stories with a lot of fighting, while some run stories with more talking (roleplaying), exploring, etc. Maybe your GM's story is a murder mystery, or the exploration of an abandoned castle.
        The number 1. rule is to always ask the GM "would my character fit your story?".

        You don't want to show up with a brutish barbarian in a game about politics and talking your way out of situations. Similarly, you don't want to show up with a character with no combat prowess in a game about slaying hordes of monsters in dungeons.
    
        Talk to your GM.
    3. Does My Character Story Fit?: |
        Similar to the first point, you must consider your character's backstory when joining a GM's story.
        When you create your character, you will probably want to give it a made-up history: a war veteran who lost their son in a battle, or a mage who gave up studies to become a warrior.
        
        Make sure this fits the story setting. If your character was born in King's Landing from Game of Thrones but the story takes place in Middle Earth, you should rethink your backstory.
        A good rule of thumb is to leave certain aspects of your character's backstory up to interpretation by the GM. That brings about more story possibilities and gives the GM a chance to surprise you with some interesting findings about your character's past!
        
        Finally, but very importantly, does your backstory even matter? Your GM might run a game where all players wake up and have amnesia. Or they might give you a specific backstory. In that case, you should understand your backstory might not matter all that much, if at all. Always ask the GM!
    4. Am I Respecting The Custom Rules?: |
        Generally, characters start being Level 1 adventurers and progress in power up to Level 10 characters. However, the GM might have you start at another level, like Level 2 or Level 5.
        
        Aside from that, the GM might impose custom rules for character creation, like not allowing certain Races or Classes in the game. If you have a dream character, make sure your choices are allowed in the GM's story.

Creating The Actual Character Part 1:
    Character Creation Basics: |
        Characters have 2 sides: the gameplay side, and the roleplay side.
        The roleplay side is what you want to look like and what your personality will be. These are not rules , but simply a matter of preference. Are you charismatic, fearful, intense, funny?
        Your personality does not affect combat or rolls - it is simply how you want to interact with the world created by the Game Master.
        
        The gameplay side refers to the rules and capabilities of the character.
        Each character is a combination of 3 things: Race, Class and Background.
        Each possible Race, Class and Background can be found on the official website and in the books.
    Character Sheet: |
        Each Character is represented on a sheet of paper (or digitally) on a document called the Character Sheet.
        The Character Sheet is a document that holds all the important stats and data about your character.
        The easiest way to make a Character Sheet is to download this form-fillable PDF. It contains modifyable text forms for everything your character needs that's gameplay-related!
        Although, note that as of 2022, if you open this PDF in the browser, you might not be able to re-save it completed! To be sure, use an application like Adobe PDF Reader or WPS to open it, modify it and save it. Always remember to save it again!
        
        Alternatively, feel free to use a regular sheet of paper, an Excel spreadsheet, or whatever you consider a good option.
        If you play in a physical location at a table, it might be a good idea to print the Character Sheet on paper for ease of use and modification.
        In the following sections, we will go over each statistic necessary for your Character.
    Character Creation Helper: |
        There is a web application called Character Creation Calculator, which can be found on the official Call of Heroes website. This Application will calculate all the numbers for your character, without you needing to do it manually (e.g. calculating your Health depending on your Race, Class and Stats).
        However, it may be useful to understand how these calculations happen, since most of them are very simple.
        The following sections also describe what each of those terms means and gives extra context.

Completing Your Character Sheet:
    Before: So, we assume you already picked your Race and Class. If you haven't, take a look at all possible Races and Classes on the website or in the book and choose a Race and a Class that you think fit together and would sounds cool to play.
    Name, Class and Race: These fields are self-explanatory. Complete the Name with your character's full name and the Player Name with your real life name (or nickname, or whatever your friends know you as).
    The 5 Stats: |
        Every Call of Heroes character's capabilities are represented by 5 statistics (Stats): Might (strength and resistance), Dexterity (agility and reflexes), Wisdom (the 5 senses, intuition and willpower), Intelligence (knowledge and magic) and Charisma (people skills).
        When you create your character, take the following numbers and assign each of them to a Stat. This is called the Stat Array or Standard Array if you want to look more into that later.

The Stats:
    - -1
    - 0
    - 1
    - 2
    - 3

Creating The Actual Character Part 2:
    Stats Explained: |
        Each Character must have a somewhat balanced stat distribution - everyone is really good at something and realy bad at something else. Your Stat with -1 will be what you are bad at.
        
        In Call of Heroes, there is no rolling for stats (like in other games). These numbers represent directly your Stat. If you make a Dexterity Check, you roll 1d12 and add your Dexterity to it. If your Dexterity is 3, then you roll 1d12 and add 3.
        
        There are no _substats_ like in other games (e.g. Skills in Dungeons and Dragons, like Acrobatics, Intimidation, or Reflex/Fortitude/Will in Pathfinder). Checks are done directly with the Stat's number (roll a d12 and add the Stat).
    Race Stat Constraints: |
        Some Races put a constraint on your Stat distribution. For example, the Orc Race (Race Features > Stat Distribution) says that your Might must be at least 2.
        That means that your Might must be either 2 or 3 from the numbers -1, 0, 1, 2, and 3. This does NOT mean that if your Might is -1 it becomes 2!

    Stat Calculations Reminder: |
        The following section will describe how each number is calculated.
        Reminder that there exists a Character Creation Calculator which automatically calculates these numbers based on your Race/Class/Background choice and your Stats.
        It is, however, good to know how they are calculated.

Stat Calculations:
    Maximum Health: Race Health + Class Health + Might
    Speed: Given by your Race, at Race Features
    Initiative: Your Dexterity + Your Charisma
    Armor: |
        Depending on your Class, you can wear Armor of a certain heaviness up to a limit. If your Class permits Medium armor, then you can wear Light and Medium Armor.
        When you create your Character, pick any Armor you can wear from the Armors page.
    Defense: Your Armor Type you are wearing. When you create your character, you can start with any armor from the armor types you can wear. Check the Armors page on the website or in the book.
    Training: |
        Look at Race Features > Weapons and Other Training to see what you are Trained in.
        Each Race and Class provides you with some Training in Weapons.
        If you are Trained in a weapon, you can use it properly. Otherwise, you can't add your Stat to the attack's damage (unless it's -1) and the weapon's effect is negated (see Weapon Training).
        So, if you plan on using a certain weapon, make sure you have Training in it.
        Some Races and Classes only give you the Training if your Intelligence is high enough when you create your character.
    Languages: |
        All Races speak the Common tongue (for our purposes, English).
        Most Races and some Classes have some extra languages they can speak.
        Like with Training, some Races and Classes require you to have a certain amount of Intelligence to know them.

Proficiencies: |
    There exist some special Abilities called Proficiencies, given by your Race, your Class and your Background (and from other sources like Feats).
    If you see the term "a Proficiency" or "Proficiencies", it refers to a Proficiency Ability (or Proficiency Abilities).
    A Proficiency Ability simply gives you a bonus to Checks for certain things, like Proficiency in Acrobatics (bonus to all Checks that can be interpreted as "acrobatics") or Proficiency in Occultism (bonus to all Checks about knowing "occult" or dark information).
    A Proficiency always gives you a bonus equal to your Character's Level. So, if you want to jump from a balcony to another and you have Proficiency in Acrobatics, you make a Dexterity Check and add your Level to that Check. The final number is your result for the Check.
    If anything here confuses you, don't worry; each Proficiency Ability states explicitly what it gives you and gives you some information about when you can use it.

Race/Class Proficiencies: |
    Every Race and Class gives you some options for Proficiency Abilities.
    Some give you some specific Proficiencies, others let you choose one of multiple Proficiencies (or both).
    Thus, there are 2 sections: "Proficiencies" and "Proficiency Choices". The "Proficiencies" section gives you ALL Proficiencies listed in that section. The "Proficiency Choices" section gives you options of Proficiencies, out of which you can pick one.
    To conclude, you get all Proficiency Abilities listed in "Proficiencies", and you can pick ONE Proficiency Ability from the "Proficiency Choices" section.

Picking Proficiencies: |
    You can take note of all your Character's Proficiencies on your Character Sheet, under the Proficiencies tab.
