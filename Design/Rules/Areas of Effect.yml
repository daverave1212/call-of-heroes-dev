Distance: |
    When calculating distance from point A to point B, calculate the distance from the square A is on to the square B is on like this:
    Start from a square near A and count squares one by one (in a line or diagonally) until you get to B. You also count the square B is on for this.    
    Remember this by thinking that if A is on the corner of B, that's a distance of 1 meter.
    
Area of Effect Distance: |
    For Abilities that affect areas, the distance is calculated to the edge square of the area.
    E.g. for a 4x4 meter area, if the range is 6 meters, there should be a path of 5 empty squares between the caster and the area.

Line: |
    If a spell targets a line, it starts from, a square right in front of you and continues in a line.
    E.g. if the line is 2 meters long, it takes the square in front of you, and the next one.

Cone: |
    Angle:
    Most cones in the game are 90 degree cones.
    On a grid, you can position a cone in 2 ways:
    With the edges diagonally on the grid (thus forming a 'stair').
    With one edge vertically and one horizontally on the grid.
    See the picture.
    Of course, you can rotate the shapes to your pleasing.
    
    Shape:
    The length of the cone dictates the maximum distance from the caster to the farthest squares of the cone.
    If the cone is stair-shaped, it always takes the shape of a quarter of a square, like in the picture.
    If the cone's edges are vertical/horizontal, the cone effectively takes the shape of a square, due to how distance math works. See Distance.
    Notice how in all of these examples, the farthest square is always the same distance from the base square.
    
    Position:
    You can choose to position the cone like this:
    If stair-shaped, you can start the cone with the base square from your left/right/up/down square OR from the square you are on.
    If vertical/horizontal, you can start the cone with the base square from any square near you OR from the square you are on.
