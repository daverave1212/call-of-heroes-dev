- The campfire is suddenly extinguished
- In the night, the caravan the players are traveling with are suddenly gone; their objects are still here though
- It is an autumn day; fire and lights suddenly stop producing light. Players have until sundown to figure out what's going on, lest everything goes black
- In the desert, the pyramid is gone overnight; instead, there is a pyramid-like hole in the ground, leading to a dungeon

- People disappear for no reason

- A group of rogues turn themselves in to the law enforcement

  - The curse should not be fatal, nor extremely life-threatening
- Players are ocasionally hunted by a large, beastly monster that can materialize and disappear, wherever they go



B. Villain
- A vampire who seeks to elliminate blood diseases from the world and targets people with genetical or blood diseases.
  His vampiric blood is a disease in itself, and it's horrible to live with.
  o His victims always have 0 blood on the ground
  o He has diabetes too
- Villain is an immortal vampire, cursed with a vampiric immortality by an old eldritch mage.
  He must feed on souls, but he only attacks those who carry eldritch artefacts on them whom he deems worthy of punishment, because they interacted with black magic.
  He sends his dementors to seek and soul-steal from those who mess with black magics.
- Villain is a cursed vampire who seeks to end his own vampirism curse (being a vampire is oddly painful).
  A prophecy told him that "his curse will end when all lights in the kingdom stop shedding light".
  So he gathers his armies of dementors to try to literally turn off all the lights in the realm at the same time.
  Dementors can be pre-sensed by noticing that lights around suddenly start shedding less light.
- Villain is a vampire - he was cursed with the 1000 curses, each identifiable with a mark on the body. If a person survives through a curse, it imposes a minor negative effect, but all 1000 together are very painful and difficult to bear.
  The only way to break the curse is to spread his 1000 curses among 1000 other people, each curse going to a different person.
  He is left with no other alternative but to attack random people and curse them. The problem is - to a lot of people, these curses are deadly. He tries to curse as many people as possible and hope they don't die (spoiler: most people die from the curse).

- Villain is a vampire who believes vampirism is a good thing. Of course, not everyone can be a vampire - there need to be people to feed on.
  Unfortunately, this was not very sustainable. His kin is endangered because there are now too many vampires and not enough people to feed on.
  Wars break out among vampires, and humanity is caught in the middle of this war.
- Villain is trying to save his lover from undeath, by becoming undead himself too.
  He needs enough souls to power an artefact that will revive his beloved.

- Villain is a bugbear who, through attacks, is trying to push civilization to the south to save them, because the forest to the north is awakening and wants to retake the lands that were deforested.
  He considers himself a vigilante and fighter for the environment, and does not despise people.
  Though, it's becoming difficult to hunt and forage for food, so his goblins and minions will steal for food and riches (and they will kill because they are chaotic, even if ordered not to).
  The bugbear slowly loses control over the tribes and the tribes of goblins forget what they're fighting for, and eventually just start warring with the civilization to the south, trying to cause as much havoc as possible, without a good reason.
  This could play into the goblin tribes who are holding the map upside down and go to war with the wrong faction.

- Villain is a mage who aims to silence magic in the realm. She will target anything that has to do with arcane magic - casters, artefacts, magic items, etc.
  She does this because every time someone uses magic, it feeds an arcane spirit who, at some point, will awaken from all the magic residue it eats (which is the true villain).
  She also really hates academic papers and the snobness of mages.

- Villain hates and seeks to elliminate dragons, because all dragons in the past turned out to be evil rulers of the world.
  He now attacks all those who have any ties to dragonhood (the place players were at contained a dragon artefact when they were ambushed).
