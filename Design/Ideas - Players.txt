      o Vampiric Lord
  o Feats for 'multiclassing' like Pathfinder 2e
    o e.g. If you wanna be more like a ranger, you get some feats that make you more like a ranger
  o Check out Pathfinder 2e feats, they are alegedly cooler

The goals for the Spell Grade rework are:
- No more monster roll (maybe player roll)
- Remove the Spell Grade Stat
- Alter the "half if they pass" mechanic; it's awkward

Crowd Control is binary: do or don't.
What kind of mechanic can I come up with that makes any CC non

Normal:
  A Unit must pass a Dexterity Check or be Stunned and take 2d10 Damage.
  If it passes, it takes half of that Damage.
  - Con: Low game feel
  - Con: Takes up sheet space and makes the game overly complex

Playerly Check Oriented (*):
  Make a Might Check against a Unit.
  If you win, the Unit takes 2d10 Damage and is Stunned.
  Otherwise, it takes half of that Damage.
  + Pro: Is clean, extensible, flexible
  - Con: Limits player choice in what abilities they get, especially Talents

Doubly Check-Oriented:
  Make a Might Check against a Unit's Dexterity.
  If you win, the Unit takes 2d10 Damage and is Stunned.
  Otherwise, it takes half of that Damage.
  + Pro: Is clean, extensible, flexible
  - Con: Counterintuitive - Players and QM's will have to learn it's not agains that exact number (Dexterity)
  - Con: Doesn't achieve much

Stat-Conditional:
  A Unit takes 2d10 Damage.
  If its Might is lower than 3, it is Stunned.
  - Con: depending on your encounters, some spells might never be usable

Crowd Control Is Free:
  A Unit takes 2d10 Damage and is Stunned.
  -- Con: Might ruin the action economy


Easy CC:
- Slowed
- Fumbling

Medium CC:
- Dazed
- Blinded
- Charmed

Semi-Hard CC:
- Silenced
- Rooted
- Feared
- Crippled

Hard CC:
- Stunned


Final Plan:
- All Easy and Medium Crowd Control is free
- All Semi-Hard and Hard Control are Check vs Check
- Abilities that require a Resist Check only for Damage now require a personalized Player Check







Abandoning an Adventure:
- Lose XP                           (doesn't work with milestones)
- Permanently lose some stat        (not fun)
- *Exhausted and need 24 hours rest (room for abuse)
- *Incentive for finishing an Adventure instead

Quest System:
- Recover all resources upon finishing a Quest
- Recover some Health Regen + 1 Inspiration after a Side Quest

Possible Scenarios for Quest System:
- Players go in dungeon for 2 objectives:
    a. Find an item
    b. Finish the dungeon
  Players find the item and say "quest complete!?"
  Fix: not part of the quest.
- Players go in dungeon for 2 objectives:
    a. Find and escort a prisoner
    b. Finish the dungeon
  Players find the prisoner, escort him, and want to continue dungeon.
  Players ask for full resources after escorting the prisoner.
  Fix: it was a Sidequest (regen + inspiration)

How to word it:
- When the players achieve something, it is the QM's call whether it was a Sidequest or a Quest.
  If you want the players to continue the adventure, simply say it was a Sidequest. Players will not regain full resources when completing a Sidequest, only a few.












Lore:
  o All lore is "suggested lore"
  o Nobody really know if there is life after death. Some say there is, some not.
    o Like yeah ghosts and spirits exist and they suffer
    o But where do they go after that?
    o Some are still contactable, some vanish without trace.

Plots:
  o A clockwork master that can fix anything. Yes that includes people. "replace the broken parts with new ones"

Actions vs Half-Actions:
  o 1 Hand-Action vs 2 Hand-Actions
 
Status Effects:
  o Crippled - make sure all classes have things that are not considered maneuvers!
 
Design:
  o Add a difficulty rating for each class and spec
  o 5e to CoH monster converter
  o Join Rolls (multiple rolls = the average; more people = more consistent)
  o Crafting mechanic based on gold as a resource (e.g. 'plants worth 13 gold')
    o "You find 13 gold worth of plants"
    o Or based on a few core items which can be given to the players as loot (e.g. soulstone)
    o E.g. Potion of Healing = 2 core items + 50 gold worth of misc materials (plants)
  o Halfsword attack (google halfswording technique - improves defense, penetrates armor)
  o Check this for extra weapon inspiration: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zcrPL3Kz3j0-CWKOS5PtTgLYA61i95ku/view
  o "You have unlimited Reactions" (on some Tank that can dash and absorb Damage)
  o Alternate rules for ranges (3 ranges: melee, close-by, far)
  o Tieflings adapt their horns/looks/eyes/etc based on what they value the most
  o Give barbarians utility
  o Spend Inspiration to gain Proficiency or Training (or even Feats)
  o Allow Talent respecs
  o DMPC's/followers die when reaching 0 HP
    o To dissuade players from going with others, followers take up XP, gold and magic items
  o Utility spells should not cost mana or insight
  o Short/Medium rest? You get 25% of your resources?
    o Or 1 heal every hour?
    o Or cooldowns don't reset
    o You get full health but no reserve Health or mana? Hmm
   

Done design:
  o Remove skills entirely and just have the backgrounds, races and classes give individual Advantage for specific things
    E.g. "You have advantage when trying to intimidate someone"
    Skills that don't fit on any stat:
    - Luck
    - Monstrology
    - Crafting
    - Use Rope
    - Dungeoneering
  o Stunt bonus
  o Make the baseline movement speed 5

Lore:
  o Ancient Great Old God that's actually really small, like Ludwig from DS3

Development:
  o Use stock images with filters
  o Should probably remake the website in React
  o Search for Web UI assets
  o Make a DM course with a few free videos with really good advice to hook people in (e.g. players say things)
    o Make sure ithas clickbait titles
  o Use dScrybe to get descriptions

Goblins:


Necromancer:
      o Lantern (Like thresh)
      o Lich upgrade
      
Bard (Jester):
      o Leave a clone behind and go invisible
  o Bard known spells aren't Damage based, but there's a talen for that
  o Skill in all rolls with a certain Stat
      
      
Elephant race:
  o Drink potions with no action
  o Large size - they DO have Reserve Health or something
  o Master architects? My ass, how do they climb? They suck at building  
 
Other race ideas:
  o Multiple hands race: No action for using items
  o Race too powerful (centaur)? Make their level 1 of level 3 power and they go up to level 8.
  o Race with manta ray wings that can glide
  o Construct race with a soul inside - can't change your armor because it's built in
  o Custom race - 6 talens every time
  o "Ask yourself - why would this race adventure"

Large Scale Combats:
  o Rules exactly like Risk
  o Different types of squads (units) in Rock-Paper-Scisors kind of battles
  o Individual player spells give small bonuses with made up rules
    o E.g. Slow prevents a whole area from moving.
   
DM Guide:
  o Apply common sense when in doubt.
    o Yes, players/DM might interpret a rule to give them an advantage, but ask yourself...
  o Exercise for new DM's: "players do X, how do you react?" take your time.

Posting tips:
- Please focus a bit more on the titles. Capitalize every word that's not 'a' or 'of' or 'the' and make it a bit longer

What are the problems of 5e?
- Watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6K2n4Aeir4
- Monsters are too bland
- DMG is shit, it should all revolve around an example campaign
- Resting is too easy
