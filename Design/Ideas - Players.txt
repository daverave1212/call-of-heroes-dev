Feats and Afflictions:
  o Feats are things that drastically change how you play your character
    o E.g. vampirism, undead, deaf, blind, etc
      o Vampiric Beast - you are forced to pick this Talent on level up... (replaces vampirism)
      o Vampiric Lord
  o Feats for 'multiclassing' like Pathfinder 2e
    o e.g. If you wanna be more like a ranger, you get some feats that make you more like a ranger
  o Check out Pathfinder 2e feats, they are alegedly cooler

Loot cases!

Lore:
  o All lore is "suggested lore"
  o Nobody really know if there is life after death. Some say there is, some not.
    o Like yeah ghosts and spirits exist and they suffer
    o But where do they go after that?
    o Some are still contactable, some vanish without trace.

Plots:
  o A clockwork master that can fix anything. Yes that includes people. "replace the broken parts with new ones"


  
Status Effects:
  o Crippled - make sure all classes have things that are not considered maneuvers!
 
Design:
  o Add a difficulty rating for each class and spec
  o 5e to CoH monster converter
  o Join Rolls (multiple rolls = the average; more people = more consistent)
  o Crafting mechanic based on gold as a resource (e.g. 'plants worth 13 gold')
    o "You find 13 gold worth of plants"
    o Or based on a few core items which can be given to the players as loot (e.g. soulstone)
    o E.g. Potion of Healing = 2 core items + 50 gold worth of misc materials (plants)
  o Halfsword attack (google halfswording technique - improves defense, penetrates armor)
  o Check this for extra weapon inspiration: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zcrPL3Kz3j0-CWKOS5PtTgLYA61i95ku/view
  o "You have unlimited Reactions" (on some Tank that can dash and absorb Damage)
  o Alternate rules for ranges (3 ranges: melee, close-by, far)
  o Tieflings adapt their horns/looks/eyes/etc based on what they value the most
  o Give barbarians utility
  o Spend Inspiration to gain Proficiency or Training (or even Feats)
  o Allow Talent respecs
  o DMPC's/followers die when reaching 0 HP
    o To dissuade players from going with others, followers take up XP, gold and magic items
  o Utility spells should not cost mana or insight
  o Short/Medium rest? You get 25% of your resources?
    o Or 1 heal every hour?
    o Or cooldowns don't reset
    o You get full health but no reserve Health or mana? Hmm
    

Done design:
  o Remove skills entirely and just have the backgrounds, races and classes give individual Advantage for specific things
    E.g. "You have advantage when trying to intimidate someone"
    Skills that don't fit on any stat:
    - Luck
    - Monstrology
    - Crafting
    - Use Rope
    - Dungeoneering
  o Stunt bonus
  o Make the baseline movement speed 5

Lore:
  o Ancient Great Old God that's actually really small, like Ludwig from DS3

Development:
  o Use stock images with filters
  o Should probably remake the website in React
  o Search for Web UI assets
  o Make a DM course with a few free videos with really good advice to hook people in (e.g. players say things)
    o Make sure ithas clickbait titles
  o Use dScrybe to get descriptions

Goblins:


Necromancer:
	o Lantern (Like thresh)
	o Lich upgrade
	
Bard (Jester):
	o Leave a clone behind and go invisible
  o Bard known spells aren't Damage based, but there's a talen for that
  o Proficiency in all rolls with a certain Stat
	
	
Elephant race:
  o Drink potions with no action
  o Large size - they DO have Reserve Health or something
  o Master architects? My ass, how do they climb? They suck at building  
  
Other race ideas:
  o Multiple hands race: No action for using items
  o Race too powerful (centaur)? Make their level 1 of level 3 power and they go up to level 8.
  o Race with manta ray wings that can glide
  o Construct race with a soul inside - can't change your armor because it's built in
  o Custom race - 6 talens every time
  o "Ask yourself - why would this race adventure"

Large Scale Combats:
  o Rules exactly like Risk
  o Different types of squads (units) in Rock-Paper-Scisors kind of battles
  o Individual player spells give small bonuses with made up rules
    o E.g. Slow prevents a whole area from moving.
    
DM Guide:
  o Apply common sense when in doubt.
    o Yes, players/DM might interpret a rule to give them an advantage, but ask yourself...
  o Exercise for new DM's: "players do X, how do you react?" take your time.
