        Dual wielding Shields requires a Feat.
        You can't use 2-Handed Weapons with a Shield.
        Any character can freely wear a Shield, as long as the Stat requirements are met. While wearing a Shield, you can't use 2-Handed Weapons, but you can use 1-Action Abilities normally. Note that a Shield requires you to be out of combat to equip or unequip.

Light:

    Unarmored:
      EffectGreen: +1 Movement Speed
      Notes: |
        No armor or very little clothing, such as a bare chest or lightly clothed body. You rely on your reflexes more than on armor.
 
    Robes:
      Price: 200
      EffectGreen: |
        +4 Initiative
      Notes: Robes vary in purpose and design. They can symbolize a wizard's robes, a priest's apparel or a noble's dress.

      Price: 230
      EffectGreen: |
        +2 Health Regen
        You can Break your Movement after doing a melee attack.
      Notes: |

        The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil.

Medium:

    Padded Armor:
      Price: 250
      EffectGreen: |
        Reduce incoming Smash, Pulse, Cold and falling Damage by 50%
      Notes: |
        Padded Armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting. Its thickness is great for absorbing heavy blunt hits... and for when you fall off a cliff. It can happen to the best of us.
        Alternatives: Hide Armor (resistance to Cold Damage instead of Pulse).

    Cuirass:
      Price: 300
      EffectGreen: |
        You heal for 10% of all melee Damage you deal (rounded down) in a Worthy Combat.
      Notes:
        A Cuirass consists of a light chestpiece made of leather and metal, with a tasset cover for the upper legs. This is an armor type favored by gladiators, barbarians and other hand-to-hand fighters who are not afraid of blood, be it theirs or their enemies'. The thrill of battle and spill of blood invigorates the wearer.

    Chain Mail:
      Price: 350
      EffectGreen: You take -50% Slash Damage and you are immune to being Slowed and Fumbling.
      Notes: Made of interlocking metal rings, Chain Mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows.

    Splint Armor:
      Price: 450
      EffectGreen: +4 Max Health
      Notes: |
        If you unquip this armor, you lose 4 Health and Max Health (down to 1).

        This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible Chain Mail protects the joints and allows soldiers to hold their ground more efficiently.
  

Heavy:

    Scale Mail:
      Price: 600
      Requirement: 2 or more Might
      EffectGreen: +1 Defense
      Downside: -1 Movement Speed and -3 Initiative
      Notes: This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish.

    Plate Armor:
      Price: 800
      Requirement: 3 or more Might
      EffectGreen: |
        +2 Defense
      Downside: |
        -5 Initiative
        Your Attacks beyond 3 meters range have Cover.
      Notes: Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body. However, the weight of the armor makes it difficult to hold still and aim at range.
