      Effect: |
        Reduce incoming Smash, Pulse, Cold and falling Damage by 50%
      Description: |
        Padded Armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting. Its thickness is great for absorbing heavy blunt hits... and for when you fall off a cliff. It can happen to the best of us.
        Alternatives: Hide Armor (resistance to Cold Damage instead of Pulse).

    Cuirass:
      Price: 300
      Effect: |
        You heal for 10% of all melee Damage you deal (rounded down) in a Worthy Combat.

This is an armor type favored by gladiators, barbarians and other hand-to-hand fighters who are not afraid of blood, be it theirs or their enemies'. The thrill of battle and spill of blood invigorates the wearer.

      Price: 350
      Effect: You take -50% Slash Damage and you have +2 to all Checks in combat.
      Description: Made of interlocking metal rings, Chain Mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows.

    Splint Armor:
      Price: 450
      Effect: +4 Max Health
      Description: This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible Chain Mail protects the joints and allows soldiers to hold their ground more efficiently!

A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body. However, the weight of the armor makes it difficult to hold still and aim at range.
