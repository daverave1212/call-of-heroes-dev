Padded Armor:
  Armor Bonus: 2
  Effect: +3 total Health
  Description: Padded Armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting. It's thickness is both a pro and a con, as it absorbs water quickly.

  Downside: You take 50% more Fire damage

Splint Armor:
  Armor Bonus: 3
  Effect: This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible Chain Mail protects the joints, yet also puts some strain on them, hence the penalty to reflexes.
  Description: +1 Movement Speed and +2 Athletics
  Downside: -5 Initiative and -3 Dexterity saves
  
Chain Mail:
  Armor Bonus: 3
  Description: Made of interlocking metal rings, Chain Mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. Noisy, but effective.

Scale Mail:
  Armor Bonus: 4
  Description: This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. Great defense capabilities, though prone to breaking by force.

Plate Armor:
  Armor Bonus: 4
  Effect: +5 maximum Health
  Description: Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.
