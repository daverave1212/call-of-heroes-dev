    # How to make an ability
# For standard spells, apply the calculations defined in the Tables.xlsx file
# For single target spells that cost Mana, feel free to round numbers up
# Every 4 levels, you can slightly increase the Damage of a Spell or give it an extra effect

    # Never make the following abilities:
# Zone of Truth (its against the roleplay design)
# Nondetection (it's an anti-DM spell that doesnt bring anything of value)

# ToDo:
# Make some good spells that Artificer - Spellcraft can benefit from (e.g. CC, small area, short range, even amount of dice)
# Make some good spells against specific enemies (giants, undead, elementals)

            Cover is applied from the object's initial position to the target.

            You create an illusion that fits at most in a 2x2x2 meter cube.
            The illusion appears real to the eyes, ears and by smell, but physical interaction makes it obvious it's an illusion and objects pass through it normally.

            On your turn, you can and must spend 1 Action to keep and/or move the illusion, otherwise it is dispelled.
