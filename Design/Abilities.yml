    # How to make an ability:
# For standard spells, apply the calculations defined in the Tables.xlsx file
# For single target spells that cost Mana, feel free to round numbers up
# Every 4 levels, you can slightly increase the Damage of a Spell or give it an extra effect

    # Never make the following:
# 0 Actions...deal 1d8 damage
# Zone of Truth (its against the roleplay design)
# Nondetection (it's an anti-DM spell that doesnt bring anything of value)

    # Notes:
# Divine Abilities that cost Mana should be slightly weaker (1 tier weaker) compared to other lists.
#   This is because Clerics and Paladins scale with Mana.



# ToDo:
# Make some good spells that Artificer - Spellcraft can benefit from (e.g. CC, small area, short range, even amount of dice)

            Can stack multiple times.
        Notes: |
            Sizes are Minuscule, Small, Medium, Large, and Larger.

    ~Major Illusion~:
        A: 1 Action
        Requirement: Level 4
        Cost: 1 Mana
        Range: 10 meters
        Effect: |
            You create an illusion that fits at most in a 2x2x2 meter cube.
            The illusion appears real to the eyes, ears and by smell, but physical interaction makes it obvious it's an illusion and objects pass through it normally.
            The illusion can deal no Damage or Crowd Control, but can provide Cover or block Line of Sight (both from the front, and from behind).
            On your turn, you can and must spend 1 Action to keep and/or move the illusion, otherwise it is dispelled.
            You can only have 1 illusion active at a time.
        Upgrade: |
            At Level 8, the illusion lasts indefinitely until you cancel it without needing to spend Actions, and it can hold its own simple movement and clockwork-like routines.
            You can also program this illusion to react on its own in a specific way to specific triggers, but the instructions must be concise - talk with your QM about this.

            The weapon has no special effect. It has 10 Health and 3 Defense.

        Requirement: Level 5
        Cost: 1 Mana
        AlignOnWebsite: Left
        HasMixins: true
        Effect: |

        Cost: 1 Mana
        AlignOnWebsite: Right
        Effect: |
            First, roll 2d100. That's how many kilograms you can levitate when you cast this.
            You can levitate one object you can see that remains within 10 meters of you.
            You can slowly move the object vertically, 1 meter for each 2 of your movement points spent to levitate.
            If you use this on an enemy, it must fail a Might Check to be levitated, and can repeat the Check at the end of each of its turns.
            A levitated Unit counts as Rooted.
            Losing concentration (taking Damage or being Crowd Controlled) instantly starts slowly dropping the target and breaks the Levitate.
        Upgrade: |
            At Level 8, the amount increases to 5d100.

    ~Polymorph~:
        A: 1 Action

            Choose an animal from the Pet List or any critter, such as a sheep, deer, etc.
            A Unit within 10 meters becomes transformed into that animal. Last a number of its turns equal to Your Intelligence - Its Intelligence (at least 1).
        Upgrade: |
            The Unit can retain its Health and Defense, but can't do any non-animal actions.
            It can do Animal Attack for 1d6 Damage if it's an enemy, or 1d6 + Sense Damage if it's an ally.
        Notes: |
            Cover is applied normally.
            A Unit can willingly fail the Check. For enemies, aside from Health and Defense, apply rules for Shapeshift. Allies can apply normal rules for Shapeshift (e.g. gain extra Health from the animal).
            If used on an Enemy, this is considered Crowd Control.
    
    ~Distort Vision~:
        A: 1 Action
        Cost: 1 Mana
        Range: 5 meters
        Requirement: Level 2

            You lose concentration if you take Damage or become crowd controlled.
        Upgrade: At Level 5, you can use 1 Action to slowly move the area up to 3 meters.
        Notes: |
            If you Skilled in a Skill that would fit, you can add that to the Check.

            The gravity becomes reversed in that area and all Units instantly fall upwards. Units can make a Dexterity Check to grab onto an object to not be lifted.
            Units suffer fall Damage if they fall onto a ceiling.
            When the effect ends, all Units fall at half velocity (and take half of the fall Damage). The same happens to a Unit if it exits the area.
            Lasts for up to 1 minute. You can cancel this effect at will.
        Notes: |
            Fall Damage is 1d6 for every 2 meters fallen (e.g. 1d6 for 2 and 3 meters, 2d6 for 4 and 5 meters, etc).

        Upgrade: You can store a number of 1x1x1 meter cubes of water equal to your Level / 2.
        Notes: Just because you target a 1x1x1 meter cube, it doesn't mean you get a 1x1x1 meter cube of water stored. For ease of use, the QM can say you drew in none, a quarter, a half, 3 quarters or a 1x1x1 meter cube of water from the targeted cube.

        Cost: 1 Mana
        Effect: |
            You spend 10 minutes learning information about an area from a point within 100km.
            You get a vision (a single snapshot) of whatever is in the line of sight from that point chosen, in any direction.
            Until your next Long rest, your party ignores Hard Terrain in the scryed area.
        Notes: |
            The Quest Master decides what visions you get - you might see that area from the past, or see only the landscape without the people. An area might also be blocked by anti-scrying magic.
            You only get one picture, one snapshot, one screenshot that is not moving.

    ~Racial Transmutation~:
        A: 1 Day
        Requirement: Level 7
        Cooldown: 1 month
        Effect: |
            You spend a whole day casting this Ability with a willing ally (or by yourself). By the end of it, the race of the ally becomes changed to a chosen Plyer Character Race (from the ones allowed by the QM).
            This changes the base stats and Racial Abilities of that Unit. It must also replace any Racial Feats it had with other Feats.
        Upgrade: This is a Conjuration Spell.
