    # How to make an ability
# For standard spells, apply the calculations defined in the Tables.xlsx file
# For single target spells that cost Mana, feel free to round numbers up
# Every 4 levels, you can slightly increase the damage of a Spell or give it an extra effect
# Costs:
    # For Mana schools, refer to the tables
    # For non-Mana schools, all Spells must be worth either about 0.75-1 Mana + Long Rest cooldown or 0 Mana and no cooldown (except utility-only spells).
        # The extra limitation here is the Cooldown; the Long Rest cooldown can compensate for the extra 0.25 over the 0.75 baseline, resulting in a total of 1 Mana per spell


    # Never make the following abilities:
# Zone of Truth (its against the roleplay design)
# Nondetection (it's an anti-DM spell that doesnt bring anything of value)

# ToDo:
# Make some good spells that Artificer - Spellcraft can benefit from (e.g. CC, small area, short range, even amount of dice)
# Make some good spells against specific enemies (giants, undead, elementals)

        Effect: After your next attack within 10 minutes, you can reroll all dice and keep the new result.
        Notes: Applies to Abilities and buffs added to the attack, like Smite. If you decide to reroll, you have to reroll ALL of them; Smite and similar abilities must be added before the reroll.

          While Hidden, you can skip your turn.
          Then, you can unhide and start your turn whenever you like (even during enemies' turns).
          If you did this, when your turn ends, you are no longer hidden.
        Notes: |
          Attacking or using Abilities or moving out of cover in relation to any enemy makes you unhides you.
          If you don't start your turn this round, you essentially lose your turn. You don't take 2 turns next round.
          If you want to start during an enemy's turn, you do so when they declare they want to do something or after they finish doing something.
          In special circumstances, the DM might ask you to make a Dexterity Check to remain Hidden.

            Only works on Units that have muscles.
        Notes: |
            E.g. if you are Level 3 and your Main Stat is 2, that limits the damage to 5.

        Notes: If you are Level 4, that's 4 square meters; meaning either 4x1 meters or 2x2 meters. The height of the obstacle can be up to 3 meters tall, but it's up to the GM's whether you can break certain tall objects.

            Fall damage is 1d6 for every meter after 2 meters fallen (e.g. 1d6 for 3 meters, 2d6 for 4 meters, etc).
