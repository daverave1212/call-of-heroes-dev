Status Effects:

Design:
  o 5e to CoH monster converter
  o Join Rolls (multiple rolls = the average; more people = more consistent)
  o Rename Fortitude to Might. Makes more sense and can encompass more skills.
  o Crafting mechanic based on gold as a resource (e.g. 'plants worth 13 gold')
    o "You find 13 gold worth of plants"
    o Or based on a few core items which can be given to the players as loot (e.g. soulstone)
    o E.g. Potion of Healing = 2 core items + 50 gold worth of misc materials (plants)

  o Tieflings adapt their horns/looks/eyes/etc based on what they value the most
  o Give barbarians utility
  o Dwarves tremorsense
  o Short rests are stupid; remove them
Done design:
  o Remove skills entirely and just have the backgrounds, races and classes give individual Advantage for specific things
    E.g. "You have advantage when trying to intimidate someone"
    Skills that don't fit on any stat:
    - Luck
    - Monstrology
    - Crafting
    - Use Rope
    - Dungeoneering
  o Stunt bonus
  o Make the baseline movement speed 5

Lore:
  o Ancient Great Old God that's actually really small, like Ludwig from DS3

Development:
  o Use stock images with filters
  o Should probably remake the website in React
  o Search for Web UI assets
  o Make a DM course with a few free videos with really good advice to hook people in (e.g. players say things)
    o Make sure ithas clickbait titles
  o Use dScrybe to get descriptions

Goblins:


Necromancer:
	o Lantern (Like thresh)
	o Lich upgrade
	
Bard (Jester):
	o Leave a clone behind and go invisible
  o Bard known spells aren't damage based, but there's a talen for that
	
	
Elephant race:
  o Drink potions with no action
  o Large size - they DO have extra health or something
  o Master architects? My ass, how do they climb? They suck at building  
  
Other race ideas:
  o Multiple hands race: No action for using items
  o Race too powerful (centaur)? Make their level 1 of level 3 power and they go up to level 8.
  o Race with manta ray wings that can glide
  o Construct race with a soul inside - can't change your armor because it's built in
  o Custom race - 6 talens every time
  o "Ask yourself - why would this race adventure"

Large Scale Combats:
  o Rules exactly like Risk
  o Different types of squads (units) in Rock-Paper-Scisors kind of battles
  o Individual player spells give small bonuses with made up rules
    o E.g. Slow prevents a whole area from moving.
    
DM Guide:
  o Apply common sense when in doubt.
    o Yes, players/DM might interpret a rule to give them an advantage, but ask yourself...
  o Exercise for new DM's: "players do X, how do you react?" take your time.
