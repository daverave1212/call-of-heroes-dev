	Story Ideas
Basically, dark souls. There were multiple mini-gods who did all sort of shit with the world, like the ones below.
The villains are ancient, giant and highly magical in a low-medium magic world.

  Side Quest Ideas (think why these questgivers don't call the authorities):
o Guy and his is robbed by bandits constantly. Help him take them down
o Someone's brother wandered off into a nearby abandoned castle.
o Magnetic pepertual motion gyroscope found. There's more inside, but shit's dangerous.

  Zone Ideas:
o Old, ruined castle covered in moss and vegetation. At its core lies an old ancient something that did this

	Culture Ideas
o Sex is illegal. Birth is conducted at marriage through magic. Prostitution is very illegal.

	Villain Ideas
o Giant wraith stuck in a giant globe
o Guy keeps the whole city under an illusion
o Guy keeps reincarnating but at what cost?
o Guy terraformed an entire country with nukes

	Wars:
o Religion wars
o Better agreements (think world war 2)

	Mission Ideas
o Kill the werewolf, but someone secretly tries to stop the players
o Strange tall creatures seen in forest (glowy eyes)
	If they go to it, they just walk into the city

  Monster Tactics
o Multiple big units
o High CC resistance
o Multiattack
o AoE attacks
o Cleave
o CC
o Ambushes
o Difficult terrain. ALWAYS HAVE DIFFERENT TERRAIN. EVERY COMBAT
o Traps in the encounter room
o More exploration. Add rooms dude, not just a 1 way corridor
o You must go at a certain time of the day
o Make sure you poison and disease all of them

	Class Tactics:
o Paladin - in your face, heal diseases and poisons
o Barbarian - survives physical Damage, deals a lot of Damage
o Bard - succeed attacks and succeed checks
o Cleric - turns, heals,

Dryad - cheese by exiting tree and going back

Hag - You have 3 turns to kill the hag (and she's protected behind xd) or drop to 0
Black Dragon - every turn, steal 1 Max Health (aura)
Black Dragon - guards fight him, they die, they get ressed as ghosts
Treants - Separates the group into 2
