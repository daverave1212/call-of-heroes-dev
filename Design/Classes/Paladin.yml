        A: Passive
        Effect: |
          Every Worthy Enemy YOU defeat grants you 1d4 Holy Points.
          You also gain Proficiency in Indimidation if you don't have it already.
      
      ~Impose~ :            # 0.25
        A: Half-Action
        Range: 3 meters
        Cooldown: Once / Adventure
        Effect: A Unit must pass a Sense Check or be Feared. It has -2 to the roll if it's a Humanoid or Unholy.

    Talents:
      Level 3:
        <Pledge of Conquest>: # 1.5
          A: Special
          Cooldown: Lifetime
          Effect: |
            Ask a party member to join your cause and pledge their honor to you.
            that person can use Divine Smite once per Adventure.
            It can also cast Lay on Hands using your Holy Points and always Knows the same Basic Divine Spells you Know at a time.
            Additionally, Oath of Conquest also happens when that ally defeats a Worthy Enemy.
          Notes: |
            You can only have one character who pledged for you and it must be within 100 meters to have access to all of those.
            The number of Holy Points of the ally does not increase.
            If you ever change this Talent, the ally loses access to all things mentioned; it regains them when you get this Talent again.
            
        # <Retribution>:      # 1
        #   A: Special
        #   Effect: |
        #     You lose Lay on Hands, but choose 2 Eldritch Spells that cost 1 Mana. You gain them permanently and, once per Adventure, you can cast each ignoring the Mana cost.
          

        <Fury Smite>:       # 1.5
          A: 0 Actions
          Effect: After an attack, deal 50% of the weapon Damage done by the attack (dice plus any modifiers) to all other Enemies within 3 meters around the target.
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure
          Notes: |
            The Damage of the attack counts as the dice rolled + any modifiers.
            Using Divine Smite over an attack, for example, does not count as added to the weapon Damage.
            Damage done means Damage inflicted after Defense and Resistances calculations.
            Cover is applied normally for the AoE.
         
        <Divine Reach>:     # 1.5
          A: 0 Actions
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure
          Effect: |
            You empower yourself to make your melee weapons send fiery waves.
            Your melee attacks have up to 3 meters range, deal 1d4 extra Damage and deal Fire Damage instead of Physical.
            Lasts 1 minute.
            Also, passively, you can now cast smites on ranged attacks (normally, you can only cast Smite on melee attacks).
          Notes: |
            Attacks like this count as either melee or ranged attacks, your choice. Targets still benefit from Cover, regardless.
            Alternatively, if it makes sense for your character, the DM might allow it to deal Cold, Necrotic or Shock Damage instead of Fire. Talk to your DM about this.

      Level 5:
      
        <Vengeance>:        # 2
            A: Passive
            Effect: |
                When a Worthy Enemy dies in combat, get a Vengeance Counter.
                Immediately when you get to 6 Vengeance Counters, gain 1 Mana or gain 1d8 Holy Points or reset the Cooldown of a Basic Spell you know (you choose).
                You keep your Vengeance Counters even inbetween Adventures.
                
        <Victory Smite>:
            A: Passive
            Effect: After half (rounded down) of Worthy Enemies in a combat have been defeated, reset the Cooldown of Divine Smite or gain 7 Holy Points (you choose).

            Effect: Use when you or an ally you can see would take Damage. Negate all the Damage.

      Level 7:

        <Personal Squire>:  # 2+
          A: Special
          Effect: |
            You recruit a squire - a trusted NPC who gains combat powers. However, the capabilities of your squire are random: roll 1d4 to determine the type of your squire, based on the Squires category at Pets and Animals (1. Bold, 2. Sneaky, 3. Clever, 4. Wise). The Race is determined by the GM or by circumstance.
            On its turn, it can do one Pet Attack, cast one Ability it has, or do the equivalent of a Half-Action (e.g. Dash, Defend, etc).
            You can recruit one squire per Adventure, but only one can follow you in your adventures at a time.
            At the start of every Adventure (and when you get this Talent), you must spend 1 Mana and train your Squire to permanently increase its Health by 2 or gain one Ability from any other Squire type.
          Upgrade: If your squire drops to 0 Health, it becomes Fallen, like a player. It has no reserve Health, but at any point outside of combat, you (the pet owner) can spend 30 minutes to tend to your squire's wounds and heal it back to full Health.
          Notes: Your squire is not a Player Character by any means and does not behave like one (it can't use Weapons, Armor, Feats, Abilities, etc like a Player Character can). It is limited to what its stat block and Abilities say it can do. You can, however, give it orders, customize its looks (hair style, clothes, etc) and it will obey your commands within reason. You are the leader it looks up to. Lead proudly and fairly!
        
        <Motivation Surge>: # 2
          A: Passive
          Effect: After you use Impose, reset the Cooldown of Divine Smite and gain 5 Holy Points.

        <Towering Figure>:
          A: Passive
          Effect: Impose now affects 2 targets. After you use Divine Smite, reset the Cooldown of Impose. All Impose targets now have -2 to the roll, not just humanoids.

        Effect: |
          You stand out for allies adjacent to you.
          Enemy ranged attacks against other allies within 1 meter of you have Cover.
        Notes: Nothing happens if an ally adjacent to you already has Cover. If you are playing on a grid, this does work for allies diagonally.

            You prepare to take a lethal blow.

            Does not apply to Passive Spells.
          Notes: |
            Increasing dice by 1 tier means, for example, d6 become d8, or d10 become d12.
            D12's and d20's don't increase.
            Class Spells are Abilities given by the class (including Talents).
