        A: Half-Action
        Range: 3 meters
        Cooldown: Once / Adventure
        Effect: A Unit must pass a Sense Check or be Feared. It has -2 to the roll if it's a Humanoid or Unholy.

    Talents:
      Level 3:
        <Pledge of Conquest>: # 1.5
          A: Special
          Cooldown: Lifetime
          Effect: |
            Ask a party member to join your cause and pledge their honor to you.
            that person can use Divine Smite once per Adventure.
            It can also cast Lay on Hands using your Holy Points and always Knows the same Basic Divine Spells you Know at a time.
            Additionally, Oath of Conquest also happens when that ally defeats a Worthy Enemy.
          Notes: |
            You can only have one character who pledged for you and it must be within 100 meters to have access to all of those.
            The number of Holy Points of the ally does not increase.
            If you ever change this Talent, the ally loses access to all things mentioned; it regains them when you get this Talent again.
            
        # <Retribution>:      # 1
        #   A: Special
        #   Effect: |
        #     You lose Lay on Hands, but choose 2 Eldritch Spells that cost 1 Mana. You gain them permanently and, once per Adventure, you can cast each ignoring the Mana cost.
          

        <Fury Smite>:       # 1
          A: 0 Actions
          Effect: After an attack, deal 50% of the weapon Damage done by the attack (dice plus any modifiers) to all enemies within 3 meters around the target (except you).
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure
          Notes: |
            The Damage of the attack counts as the dice rolled + any modifiers.
            Using Divine Smite over an attack, for example, does not count as added to the weapon Damage.
            Damage done means Damage inflicted after Defense and Resistances calculations.
            Cover is applied normally for the AoE.
         
        <Divine Reach>:     # 1
          A: 0 Actions
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure

            You empower yourself to make your melee weapons send fiery waves.
            Your melee attacks have up to 3 meters range, deal 1d4 extra Damage and deal Fire Damage instead of Physical.
            Lasts 1 minute.
            Also, passively, you can now cast smites on ranged attacks (normally, you can only cast Smite on melee attacks).
          Notes: |
            Attacks like this count as either melee or ranged attacks, your choice. Targets still benefit from Cover, regardless.
            Alternatively, if it makes sense for your character, the DM might allow it to deal Cold, Necrotic or Shock Damage instead of Fire. Talk to your DM about this.
