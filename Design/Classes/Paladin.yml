        <Pledge of Conquest>: # 1.25
          A: Special
          Cooldown: Lifetime
          Effect: |
            Ask a party member to join your cause and pledge his/her honor to you.
            If it accepts, it gains its own pool of 6 Holy Points and can use Lay on Hands.
            That ally also benefits from Oath of Conquest.
            At any point, you can transfer any number of Holy Points from you to that ally, but not vice versa.
          Notes: |
            You can only have one character who pledged for you.
            The number of Holy Points of the ally does not increase.
            
        <Retribution>:      # 1
          A: Special
          Effect: |
            You lose Lay on Hands, but can Know 2 more Generic Abilities and gain access to the Eldritch Spell List. For you, if an Eldritch Spell costs 1 Mana, it instead has a Long Rest Cooldown (regardless of its normal Cooldown).

          Cooldown: Long Rest
          Notes: |
            The damage of the attack counts as the dice rolled + any modifiers.
            Using Divine Smite over an attack, for example, does not count as added to the weapon damage.
            Damage done means damage inflicted after Defense and Resistances calculations.
