Class: Paladin
Description: |
  Behold, a knight clad in armor, commanding the king's army with unvavering determination, his presence inspiring the rallied masses trailing in his wake while striking fear into the hearts of the enemy ranks! A heavy blow of his lance shatters the enemy's defence line, clearing a path for victory. Radiating with divine energy of righteousness and bearing the standard of his allegiance, the paladin fearlessly presses forward, to victory!
  Paladins are the knights, the crusaders and the vigilantes who bear divine magic through conviction and purpose, perhaps aided by their god, rather than mastery over the arcane. They are able to both heal, resist damage and fell enemies with holy retribution.
  Be it by the sword, by the shield or by the book, paladins join (or form) an order or community of like-minded individuals, and follow their calling into battle - to attack, to protect, to serve for a greater future.

  Recommended Abilities Description: |
    As a Paladin, you must make use of your limited Spells as best as possible. Solace Wave is a solid heal, while Smite will come in handy when you wish to deal extra Damage. Asses Their Ranks is a decent survivability tool; hold it for when you are fighting multiple enemies. If you have no other options to do with a Half-Action, use Solace Wave in combination with Holy Grace in order to not waste resources on your turn!

Starting Abilities Description:
  - Faith Casting: |
      Paladins are not true spellcasters and don't draw power from magical Mana, but rather from their conviction and courage on the battlefield. As such, you can fill your Known Abilities with powerful Ablities and you can use each of them once. This will get better as you Level up, allowing you to pick more options and even Spells that cost more than 1 Mana, which will be free for you! Pick wisely!
  - Holy Grace: |
      Use Holy Grace when you are in need of healing either yourself or an ally, or you need to dish out some quick, surefire Damage.
      Since this takes a Half-Action, get a 1-Handed weapon to fill your turn with something to do after using Holy Grace (or get a Spell that takes a Half-Action).
  - Divine Sense: |
      You have the power to detect foul creatures within range. Use this carefully only when you believe you need to, as it has a long cooldown.

        Effect: |
          When ^YOU^ defeat one Worthy Enemy, all excess Damage is converted to healing or Divine Damage to a Unit within 5 meters of you.
        Notes: E.g. if a Unit has 5 Health and you deal 12 Damage, the Unit dies and you heal an ally (or yourself) for 7 Health using your Reaction, or blast another Unit for 7 Divine Damage. If you kill multiple Units at the same time, this triggers only for one of them.

        Notes: |

        #   A: Special
        #   Effect: |
        #     You lose Lay on Hands, but choose 2 Eldritch Spells that cost 1 Mana. You gain them permanently and, once per Adventure, you can cast each ignoring the Mana cost.
          

        # <Fury Smite>:
        #   _Value: 1.5
        #   A: 0 Actions
        #   Effect: After an attack, deal 50% of the weapon Damage done by the attack (dice plus any modifiers) to all other Enemies within 3 meters around the target.
        #   Cooldown: Once / Adventure
        #   Notes: |
        #     The Damage of the attack counts as the dice rolled + any modifiers.
        #     Using Divine Smite over an attack, for example, does not count as added to the weapon Damage.
        #     Damage done means Damage inflicted after Defense and Resistances calculations.
        #     Cover is applied normally for the AoE.

        <Jihad>:
          _Value: No idea
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            When healing yourself with Crusade, increase the healing by 50%.
            Additionally, you can heal yourself with Holy Grace.

        <Retribution>:
          _Value: 1.25
          A: Half-Action
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure
          Range: 3 meters

        <Flaming Reach>:
          _Value: 1.5
          A: Half-Action
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure
          Duration: 1 minute
          Effect: |
            Your weapon takes on a fiery aspect.
            Your first melee attack every turn has up to 3 meters range, deals Fire Damage instead of Physical and deals 1d4 Fire Damage to the target and all Enemies within 2 meters of the target.
          Upgrade: Passively, you can now cast Smite Abilities on ranged attacks.
          Notes: |
            Attacks like this count as either melee or ranged attacks, your choice. Targets still benefit from Cover, regardless.
            Alternatively, if it makes sense for your character, the DM might allow it to deal Cold, Scourge or Shock Damage instead of Fire. Talk to your DM about this.

      Level 5:

        <Join the Crusade>:
          _Value: 2
          A: Special
          Cooldown: Lifetime
          AlignOnWebsite: Right
          Effect: |
            Ask a party member to join your cause and pledge their honor to you.
            That person has the Crusade Ability and the same Tier 1 Talent you have.
            It also has access to the Divine Ability List.
          Notes: |
            Only one person can pledge for you and it must within sight or hearing to have access to all of those.
            If you ever change this Talent, the ally loses access to all things mentioned; it regains them when you get this Talent again.

        <Suspension of Belief>:
          A: Passive
          HasMixins: true
          AlignOnWebsite: Left
          Effect: |
            While you have no Abilities that would cost Mana available to cast, your Paladin Abilities can be cast _Twice_ (e.g. Twice / Adventure, Twice / hour, Twice / Combat, etc).
          Notes: |
            You can achieve Suspension of Belief either by having no Known Abilities with a Mana cost, or having already cast all Abilities you Know that would cost Mana (via Faith Casting).
            Be wary of your faith, though, for gods seldom hold a positive outlook on those putting their conviction on hiatus.

        <Culling Smite>:
          _Value: 2.25
          A: 0 Actions

          Notes: Can not be used at the same time with other "Smite" Abilities.

        <Lay on Hands>:

          A: 1 Action
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure

        # <Vengeance>:
        #   _Value: 2
        #   A: Passive
        #   Effect: |
        #       When a Worthy Enemy dies in combat, get a Vengeance Counter.
        #       Immediately when you get to 6 Vengeance Counters, gain 1 Mana or gain 1d8 Holy Points or reset the Cooldown of a Basic Spell you know (you choose).
        #       You keep your Vengeance Counters even inbetween Adventures.
                
      Level 7:

        <Personal Squire>:
          _Value: 3
          A: Special
          AlignOnWebsite: Left
          Effect: |
            You recruit a squire - a trusted NPC who gains combat powers. However, the capabilities of your squire are random: roll 1d4 to determine the type of your squire, based on the Squires category at Pets and Animals (1. Bold, 2. Sneaky, 3. Clever, 4. Wise). The Race is determined by the QM or by circumstance.
            On its turn, it can do one Pet Attack, cast one Ability it has, or do the equivalent of a Half-Action (e.g. Sprint, Push).
            You can recruit one squire per Adventure, but only one can follow you in your adventures at a time.
          Upgrade: If your squire drops to 0 Health, it becomes Fallen, like a player. It has no Health Regen, but at any point outside of combat, you (the pet owner) can spend 30 minutes to tend to your squire's wounds and heal it back to full Health.
          Notes: Your squire is not a Player Character by any means and does not behave like one (it can't use Weapons, Armor, Feats, Abilities, etc like a Player Character can). It is limited to what its stat block and Abilities say it can do. You can, however, give it orders, customize its looks (hair style, clothes, etc) and it will obey your commands within reason. You are the leader it looks up to. Lead proudly and fairly!

            Choose a Unit with 50% or less Health.
            A colossal spectral lance hits it and ^crushes it to death^.
          Upgrade: Against Epic monsters, the threshold is 15% or less Health instead.
          Note: |
            You always know if a Unit would die from this (ask the QM).
            The Unit dies.

            ~Deals 50% extra Damage to Units affected by Crowd Control.~
          Upgrade: ~The Cooldown is Once / Combat.~
          Notes: This can't heal yourself.

      Level 8:

        <Stat Bonus 5>: Inherit

        <Known Ability Bonus>:

          A: Half-Action
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure
          Duration: Until end of next turn
          Effect: |
            You burst with angelic wings and burning vim.
            Until the end of your next turn, you have 50% extra Movement and can fly, and can cast unlimited Abilities that cost Mana, ignoring the Mana cost and the limits of Faith Casting.
          Upgrade: You can't use the same Basic Ability twice on the same turn.
          Notes: E.g. let's say you used Smite last turn. This turn you activate Aspect of Ascension. You make a 1-Handed weapon attack, and add Smite to it as well. Next turn, you cast Solace Wave and Hand of Freedom, then make anther attack to which you add Smite. Then, you end your turn and Aspect of Ascension ends. You can now still cast Solace Wave and Hand of Freedom once.

          You Know one extra Ability.
        Notes: |
          For example, if you can Know 3 Abilities, you can Know Smite, Solace Wave and Solace Wave. This means you can cast Solace Wave twice per Adventure. Or you could get Smite, Smite, Smite. Be creative!
          You lose access to Innate Grace and your other Talents if you don't have the book somewhere at hand, such as hanging by your belt, in your hand or in your pocket. Should you lose the book, you can buy another one for 200 Gold at a respective temple.

            A spectral self appears at the position where you started your turn, and repeats all Acts you have already done this turn.
          Notes: The clone moves exactly as you did (can go through Units) and repeats the Spells and Attacks on the same targets. If there were any dice rolls, the clone rolls them (don't use the same numbers rolled). The clone is a separate special Unit - self effects apply to the clone (and thus self-heals have no effect).
