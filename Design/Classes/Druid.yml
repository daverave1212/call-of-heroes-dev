Class: Druid
Description: |
  Traveling this harsh environment, you spot an unusually ornate stone - it's a monolith, tribute to the sun and the forest. You are passing through a druid's domain, and he or she might just be watching you from the eyes and form of a woodland critter, ready to leap upon you as a mighty wolf, or in the form of an otherworldly creature of the forest. Travelers beware!
  Druids are guardians of their domain, be it a lush forest, a barren wasteland, the peak of a mountain, or the depth of the sea. Most druids can transform into various animals, some even able to invent their own fauna and flora to shape their domain, while others forgo nature entirely to focus on studying the old ways of the cosmos.
  A druid is a spellcaster heavily attuned to their environment, who can shapeshift into animals, cast nature magic and channel the old powers of the stars themselves.

Quick Note: A druid is a spellcaster heavily attuned to their environment, who can shapeshift into animals, cast nature magic and channel the old powers of the stars themselves.

Druidic: |
    Whistletone is the art of conveying information at long distances through whistles, claps and snaps. Druids specifically can also incorporate magic into their Whistletone to mimick the breeze of the wind, the subtle sound of thunder in the distance, or even replicate smells and miasmas to convey hidden messages.

Starting Abilities Description:
    - Druidcraft: |
        Druids have the ability to create small magical effects that affect plants, animals or just nature.
        You can use the Druidcraft Spell in roleplay scenarios to affect the environment and people.
    - Shapeshift: |
        As a Druid, you can tranform into various animals, both in combat and outside of combat.
        The Shapeshift Spell provides an infinite amount of options to help out your party in any situation!
        You can choose any animal from the Animals list to Shapeshift into, as long as it's not Exotic or non-standard. Each Animal allows you to use its special Ability once per Adventure. You are still only allowed to use that Ability once per Adventure, even if you Shapeshift into that animal twice (the cooldown stays the same).
        Other Druid Talents might allow you to Shapeshift into more unusual beasts.
        Shapeshift is considered a Spell.

        When in Shapeshift form, you always have access to the Animal Attack Ability, which is not considered a Spell.
        Animal Attack is, of course, impaired if you are Crippled.

    Effect: |
      Pick an animal from the `Pets and Animals page$/Other/PetsAndAnimals`, within your Level, and instantly transform into it.

      While Shapeshifted, you can speak, but your voice is slightly altered to match your shape (e.g. guttural for lions, high pitched for birds, etc).

          HasMixins: true
          Effect: |
            You have an animal pet that can fight alongside you, but your Max Mana decreases by 1 and your Health by 5. Check out the `Pets and Animals page$/Other/PetsAndAnimals` and choose an Animal from the Pets section, ignoring those Level requirements!
            Your pet takes its turn at the same time as you do, and always has the same Initiative as yours, and can make normal Checks using using its own Stats.
            It has 1 Action per turn, which it can use to do its own Abilities or Pet Attack.
            Your pet will not stray more than 30 meters away from you in hostile territory.
          Upgrade: If your pet drops to 0 Health, it becomes Fallen, like a player. It has no Health Regen, but at any point outside of combat, you (the pet owner) can spend 30 minutes to tend to your pet's wounds and heal it back to full Health.
          Notes: |
            Your pet can't rise from being Fallen while in combat, even if healed.
            If your pet ever dies, you can spend 8 hours inbetween Adventures to get a new pet. If you want to change your Pet and abandon your current one, you can do so inbetween Adventures, but the guilt will make you Fumbling for the next 2 Worthy Combat encounters.

            They appear on the edge of the battlefield, from the wilderness, and they fight for you for up to 1 minute.

        Upgrade: |
          At first, you can't fly, even if your animal can. If your animal can fly, you have the Jumping Skill and you can glide (you don't take falling Damage).
          From Level 6, you can fly.
        Notes: |
          For example, you could transform into a combination of Bird of Prey and Bear, resulting in a Bowlear, with Shielding and a lot of Defense! Be creative!
          The animal size is either the larger or the smaller of the two - your choice.
          Even if you Shapeshift into 2 combinations of a same animal, the cooldown of that animal's Ability persists (e.g. you can't use Bear's Maul twice its Cooldown, no matter what animal combination you transform into).

            The Pixie has 5 Defense, 5 Health, 5 meters Movement Speed.
            It takes its turn at the same time as you. While in combat, on its turn, it has the equivalen of 1 Action, and can either melee attack for 1 Pulse Damage or heal a non-Fallen Unit for 1 Health. Instead of that, it can also use Taunt or use consumable items like potions or scrolls. 
          Upgrade: |
            If it goes more than 50 meters away from you, it becomes unsummoned (you can summon it back by channeling for 10 minuets).
            The Pixie has Charisma, Sense and Intelligence equal to yours, but its Dexterity is 0 and its Might is -5.
          Notes: The Pixie can stay in your backpack or pocket if you don't want it to take Damage. Decide with your QM whether you or the QM controls the Pixie roleplay-wise, and whether it is sentient. Have fun!

            When you want to do this, roll a Deception check.
            This check determines how close you get to the form of that person (12 or more means a perfect copy).
            This copy just mimicks the look of the person, not the voice or personality.
          Notes: |
            You can cast your own spells while transformed into someone else.
            Other people are not considered Animals, so you can't use Wild Shape to transform into a combination of a person and an Animal.

#       Witch druids use eldritch magic of the nature to bend reality in an unseen way, cast curses and dispell magic.

#       Wiccan Druids believe no one has the right to dictate someone else's spiritual path.
#       As a Wiccan Druid, you oppose fanaticism, opressors and stupidity.
#       Wiccan Druids worship no god, but they do acknowledge their power and they heavily respect nature and the earth.

#             You can instead spend 6 Health to cast Black Charm.
