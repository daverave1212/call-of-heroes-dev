Starting Abilities:
  ~Druidcraft~ :            # Ok
    A: Depends
    Effect: |
      You can create harmless sensory effects or tiny weather effects (6 meters range).
      You can massively speed up the growth of small plants (touch range).
      You can slightly soothe physical pains (with no combat effect) (touch range).
      You can attempt to communicate simple ideas with animals and plants (3 meters range).
      You have +3 on rolls for identifying plants.
      You can do these even while Shapeshifted.

  ~Shapeshift~ :            # Ok
    A: 1 Action
    Cost: 1 Charge
    Effect: |
      Pick an animal from the Animal Pets and Shapeshift Animals list and instantly transform into it.
      You gain that animal's Fortitude and Dexterity saves.
      Apply any other modifiers (except for base Stats) from that animal.
      You also gain its exact abilities.
      Attacking while Shapeshifted has the same attack bonus, damage, weapon effect, etc as your normal attacking weapon.
      So, while Shapeshifted, you can perform normal *melee* weapon attacks as if you were not Shapeshifted.
      While Shapeshifted, you can do any maneuvers you know. You can't cast spells.
      Health: When you Shapeshift, if the animal has more total health than you, add the difference to your health.
      If it has less, subtract the difference.
      When Shapeshift ends, subtract back whatever health you added, or add back whatever health you subtracted.
      When you end Shapeshift, if your health would be 0 or less, it stays at 1.
      Shapeshift ends if you drop to 0 Health, and you go Unconscious.
      At first, you can't choose innately swimming or flying animals.
      From level 4, you can transform into innately swimming animals.
      From level 8, you can transform into innately flying animals.
    Notes: |
      You can't make attacks with ranged weapons while Shapeshifted (obviously).
      You choose what items you keep on you when Shapeshifting, and those items are 'merged' into your new form.
      You can turn back into your humanoid form for 0 Actions (on your turn).

	
Specializations:
    Description: At Level 1, you can choose your coven (Specialization). A coven is a spiritual path you adhere to, and whose culture you represent.
    Choices:
      - Coven of the Old Ways, using the old magic, worshipping old gods and drawing power from the sun, the moon and the stars
      - Coven of the Wild, where your true fey or animalistic nature takes shape!
      - Coven of the Wicked, where nature-infused eldritch magic overcomes your mind, body and soul
      - Coven of the Land, a protector of the flora and fauna specific to your chosen domain
	

Specs:
  
  Coven of the Old Ways:
    Description: |
      You worship the sun, the moon and the stars, for only they can truly guide your path.
      Pagan Druids believe no one has the right to dictate someone else's spiritual path.
      As a Pagan Druid, you oppose fanaticism, opressors and stupidity.
      Pagan Druids worship no god, but they do acknowledge their power and they heavily respect nature and the earth.
      A Pagan Druid gains the power through not black, nor white eldritch magic.
      The suggested alignment for Pagan Druids is True Neutral.
      # - Skulls
      # - Runes and Symbols
      # - Elements
      # - choose a symbol for yourself
      # - Coven (not only ofr duirds, but yk witchcraft n shit)
      # - Rely on components, scrying
      # - Casts diviner magic
      # - Has the 'swap' die roll mechanic
      # - Can force die rerolls
      # - These are in the form of rituals
      # - Ex: name a round. In that round, ...
      
    Starting Abilities:
      ~Day Night Cycle~ :       # Ok
        A: Passive
        Effect: |
          Instead of knowing one set of spells, as normal, you know two: one for the moon, and one for the sun.
          The Moon spells can only be used at night (from end of dusk until start of dawn).
          The Sun spells can only be used at day (from start of dawn until end of dusk).
          The Sun spell set and the Moon spell set can not contain any of the same spell.
          Whenever you learn a new spell, choose to put it either in the Sun spell set or the Moon spell set.
        Notes:
          So, in total, you know twice as many spells.
        Downside:
          Once you prepare a spell for Day or Night, you can no longer assign it to the other one. Ever.
      
      ~Moonfire/Sunfire~ :      # Ok
        A: 0.5 Actions
        Cost: 1 Charge
        Range: 6 meters
        Effect: |
          A target within 6 meters makes a Wisdom save.
          If it fails, it takes 1d8 + 1 Fire and is Crippled (if day) or Force damage and is Silenced (if night).
          If you use this at night, you can't use it until day, and vice versa.

          A: 10 minutes
          Cooldown: Long Rest
          Effect: |
            Gain 1 Charge.
            The Old Ritual must be performed outdoors, in a safe, uncorrupted place untouched by regular folk.
          Downside:
            You permanently lose the Shapeshift ability, and you can never choose Talents that improve Shapeshift.
        
        <Lycanthropy> :         # Ok
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            During the night (24:00 to 6:00) you can Shapeshift into a Lycanthrope (see Lycanthrope form).
            A Lycanthrope is a 
            
        <Animal Companion> :    # :/ bit strong
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            You have an animal pet that can fight alongside you!
            Your animal has stats depending on its species.
            By default, apply the following stats to your pet (these will get modified by your pet's species):
            - Health: Half of yours
            - Movement: 6 meters
            Your pet takes its turn at the same time as you do, and always has the same initiative as yours.
            Your pet can make normal Skill Checks using your Skill bonuses, or its own, using its special Stats.
            Your pet will not stray more than 30 meters away from you in hostile territory.
            On your turn, you can command it to move, but it can't take its own Actions.
            You and your pet share the same Actions on a turn.
            (ex: If you have 1 Action, your pet can use 0.5 Actions to attack and you can use 0.5 Actions to attack too, or your pet spends 1 Action and you skip your Actions, etc.)
            All pets have the Pet Attack ability:
              <Pet Attack> : 0.5 Actions
              The pet melee attacks a target.
              The attack deals 1d10 + Main Stat.
              You can do this once per turn.
              Some abilities may say 'Perform a Pet Attack'. In that case, ignore the once-per-turn.


  Coven of the Wild:
    Description: You are heavily in touch with nature and with strange creatures, uncommon to the normal folk.
    Starting Abilities:
      ~Wild Shape~ :            # 0.25
        A: Passive
        Effect: |
          When you use Shapeshift, you can transform into a combination of 2 animals.
          You take the highest stat from both animals, and you have access to both of their abilities.
        Notes: |
          For example, you could transform into a combination of Bird of Prey and Bear, resulting in a kind of Owlbear, with a lot of health and a lot of Armor! Be creative!
          The animal size is either the larger or the smaller of the two.

    Talents:
      Level 2:
        <Forest Friend>:          # 0.25
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            You have a Pixie companion, a very small humanoid with wings.
            The Pixie has 20 Armor and always stays with you.
            If the Pixie goes more than 10 meters away from you, it becomes unsummoned (you can summon it back with a 5 minute ritual).
            You can command the Pixie simple instructions for 0 Actions, like 'go there' or 'pick up that object'.
            The Pixie has Charisma, Wisdom and Intelligence equal to yours, but its Dexterity is 0 and its Strength is -10.
            Decide with your DM whether you or the DM controls the Pixie roleplay-wise.
            Have fun!        

        <Treesposition>:          # 0.25
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            Touch a large or larger piece of wood and choose one of the following:
            1. Teleport near another large or larger piece of wood within 6 meters.
            2. Partially enter the piece of wood, becoming camouflaged. You have +5 Stealth until you exit back to your normal space.
            You can stay like that for up to 1 hour.
            You can do this once per day for free, or for 1 Charge.
            You benefit from Cover while inside a tree.
          
        <Copy Cat>:               # 0.25
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            You can now use Shapeshift to also transform into other people.
            When you want to do this, roll a Deception check.
            This check determines how close you get to the form of that person (20 or more means a perfect copy).
            This copy just mimicks the body of the person, not the voice or personality or clothes.
            Your Fortitude and Dexterity also change to that person's stats, but not your Health, Armor, Charges, etc.
            Your Fortitude and Dexterity skill bonuses and Saves change to exactly equal to your new stats.
            Your Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma skill bonuses, Stats and Saves stay the same as your normal ones.
            This shapeshift ends if you get Crowd Controlled (other than Slow).
            You can only copy a person once per day.

  Coven of the Wicked:
    Description: |
      Witch druids use eldritch magic of the nature to bend reality in an unseen way, cast curses and dispell magic.
      However, this comes at a price, usually of its own sanity and control over the powers.
      Wiccan Druids believe no one has the right to dictate someone else's spiritual path.
      As a Wiccan Druid, you oppose fanaticism, opressors and stupidity.
      Wiccan Druids worship no god, but they do acknowledge their power and they heavily respect nature and the earth.
      A Wiccan Druid gains the power through not black, nor white eldritch magic.
      The suggested alignment for Wiccan Druids is True Neutral.

    Starting Abilities:
      ~Witchcraft~:
        A: Passive (Special)
        Effect: |
          You have 0 Witch points.
          All Druid-class-abilities (except Druidcraft) generate 1 Witch point.
          All non-Druid-class-abilities that use at least 1 Charge remove 1 Witch point.
        Downside:
          For every extra Witch point you have over 3, you take 1 damage on every short rest instead of healing.
        Notes:
          You can't have less than 0 Witch points.
          You can simply use Charges to remove Witch points in between Long Rests.

      ~Dispelling Ritual~:          # Ok
        A: 5 minutes
        Effect: |
          Dispells all negative debuffs, poisons, paralyzes, minor curses from allies attending the ritual.
          After that, in the next encounter, after the first time an enemy casts a spell (non-naturally), it rolls a Charisma save.
          If it fails, it is Silenced.
        
      ~Black Charm~:                # Ok
        A: 1 Action
        Cost: 2 Charges
        Range: 6 meters
        Effect: |
          A creature that can see and hear you makes a Wisdom save.
          If it fails it is Charmed for 1 turn.
          When the Charm ends (at the end of its turn), it takes 4d4 psychic damage.

          A: Special
          Effect: |
            You take a pilgrimage of 7 days alone outdoors, in a safe, uncorrupted place untouched by regular folk.
            After this time, you transform a piece of natural rock into a summoning portal, by aligning it, other natural elements around it and decorating it according to the stars.
            Choose an ally within 100 kilometers of the stone. That ally will know when you are trying to summon them.
            By you spending 3 Charges, you and a willing ally can spend 1 Hour summoning that willing ally to the location of the stone if that ally is within 100 kilometers of the stone.
            You can summon an ally once a week.
            You can take a new pilgrimage once a year.
          Notes: For an ally to be summoned, it must have a clear state of mind and it must focus together with the caster for 1 hour.

            (ex: If you have 1 Action, your pet can use 0.5 Actions to attack and you can use 0.5 Actions to attack too, or your pet spends 1 Action and you skip your Actions, etc.)
            All pets have the Pet Attack ability:
              <Pet Attack> : 0.5 Actions
              The pet melee attacks a target.
              The attack deals 1d10 + Main Stat.
              You can do this once per turn.
              Some abilities may say 'Perform a Pet Attack'. In that case, ignore the once-per-turn.
