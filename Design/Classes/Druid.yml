Druidic: |
    Druidic is the art of conveying information through wind, soil, bark, etc. Similarly to the written version of Thieves' Cant, Druidic is indistinguishable from regular nature, but it contains messages meant for other druids through means like the way bark is growing on a tree, unusual moss formations, unusual winds, etc. These often convey messages like "monster lair", "hidden path", "healing plants ahead", etc.

Starting Abilities Description:
    - Druidcraft: |
        Druids have the ability to create small magical effects that affect plants, animals or just nature.
        You can use the Druidcraft Spell in roleplay scenarios to affect the environment and people.
    - Shapeshift: |
        As a Druid, you can tranform into various animals, both in combat and outside of combat.
        The Shapeshift Spell provides an infinite amount of options to help out your party in any situation!
        You can choose any animal from the Animals list to Shapeshift into, as long as it's not Exotic or non-standard. Each Animal allows you to use its special Ability once per Adventure. You are still only allowed to use that Ability once per Adventure, even if you Shapeshift into that animal twice (the cooldown stays the same).
        Other Druid Talents might allow you to Shapeshift into more unusual beasts.
        Shapeshift is considered a Spell.

        When in Shapeshift form, you always have access to the Animal Attack Ability, which is not considered a Spell.
        Animal Attack is, of course, impaired if you are Crippled.

    A: Half-Action
    Cooldown: 2 times / Adventure (see effect)
    Effect: |
      Pick an animal from the Pets and Animals list and instantly transform into it.
      
      For Checks, you can choose to use the animal's Stats or your Stats.
      You also gain its exact Abilities and Animal Attack (see below), but can't cast Spells or use items (obviously).

      Shapeshift ends if you drop to 0 Health, and you Fall.

      You can turn back into your person form for 0 Actions (on your turn).
      While Shapeshifted, you can speak, but your voice is slightly altered to match your shape (e.g. guttural for lions, high pitched for birds, etc).

          Upgrade: Every Worthy _midnight_, if this is not on Cooldown, roll 1d20. If you roll 20, you automatically transform into a Lycanthrope. This rule can be overridden by the GM.

  Coven of the Wild:
    Description: You are heavily in touch with nature and with strange creatures, uncommon to the normal folk.
    Starting Abilities:
    
      ~Wild Shape~:
        _Value: 2
        A: Passive
        Effect: |
          After using Shapeshift, you gain back the Half-Action spent on it.
          When you use Shapeshift, you can transform into a combination of 2 animals.
          You take the highest Stat from both animals, and you have access to both of their Abilities.
        Notes: |
          For example, you could transform into a combination of Bird of Prey and Bear, resulting in a Bowlear, with Shielding and a lot of Defense! Be creative!
          The animal size is either the larger or the smaller of the two - your choice.
          Even if you Shapeshift into 2 combinations of a same animal, the cooldown of that animal's Ability persists (e.g. you can't use Bear's Maul twice per Adventure, no matter what animal combination you transform into).

    Talents:
      Level 3:
        <Forest Friend>:
          _Value: 1
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            You have a flying Pixie companion, a very small person with wings.
            The Pixie has 5 Defense, 5 Health, 5 meters Movement Speed.
            It takes its turn at the same time as you. While in combat, on its turn, it has the equivalen of 1 Action, and can either melee attack for 1 Force Damage or heal a non-Fallen Unit for 1 Health. Instead of that, it can also use Taunt or use consumable items like potions or scrolls. 
          Upgrade: |
            If it goes more than 50 meters away from you, it becomes unsummoned (you can summon it back by channeling for 10 minuets).
            The Pixie has Charisma, Sense and Intelligence equal to yours, but its Dexterity is 0 and its Might is -5.
          Notes: The Pixie can stay in your backpack or pocket if you don't want it to take Damage. Decide with your GM whether you or the GM controls the Pixie roleplay-wise, and whether it is sentient. Have fun!

        <Treesposition>:
          _Value: 0.75
          A: 0 Actions or Reaction
          Cooldown: 2 times / Adventure
          Effect: |
            Touch a large or larger piece of wood and choose one of the following:
            1. Teleport near another large or larger piece of wood within 8 meters.
            2. Partially enter the piece of wood, becoming camouflaged. You have +5 Stealth until you exit back to your normal space.
            You can stay like that for up to 1 hour.
            You benefit from Cover while inside a tree.
            As a Reaction, you can use this when you are attacked or right when someone casts a spell (before the roll).
          Notes: If you use this as a Reaction and the attack would fail (out of range, no line of sight, etc), the attacker can then choose a different Act or target.
          
        <Exotic Shapeshift>:
          _Value: 1
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            You can now Shapeshift into Exotic Animals.
            You can also use Shapeshift to also transform into other people.
            When you want to do this, roll a Deception check.
            This check determines how close you get to the form of that person (12 or more means a perfect copy).
            This copy just mimicks the look of the person, not the voice or personality.
          Notes: |
            You can cast your own spells while transformed into someone else.
            Other people are not considered Animals, so you can't use Wild Shape to transform into a combination of a person and an Animal.

      Level 5:
      
        <Shapeshift Ally>:
          _Value: 1.5

            They have Animal Attack and all of the animal's Abilities.
            They can cancel it for 0 Actions on their turn.

          HasMixins: true
          Effect: When Shapeshifting yourself, it doesn't consume a ^use^.
          Notes: This means that unless you use Shapeshift Ally, you can Shapeshift as much as you like. Note that the Cooldowns of Animal Abilities persist and don't reset.
        
        <Werebeast Blood>:
          _Value: 1.5
          A: Passive
          Effect: You can Shapeshift into a combination of 3 animals. You gain 7 Max Health.

        <Beastly Stamina>:
          _Value: 2

    Description: |
      You worship the sun, the moon and the stars, for only they can truly guide your path.
      Pagan Druids believe no one has the right to dictate someone else's spiritual path.
      As a Pagan Druid, you oppose fanaticism, opressors and stupidity.
      Pagan Druids usually worship no god, but they do acknowledge their power and they heavily respect nature and the earth.
      A Pagan Druid gains the power through not black, nor white magic.
      The suggested alignment for Pagan Druids is True Neutral.

      #   A: Passive
      #   Effect: |
      #     Instead of knowing one set of spells, as normal, you know two: one for the moon, and one for the sun.
      #     The Moon spells can only be used at night (from end of dusk until start of dawn).
      #     The Sun spells can only be used at day (from start of dawn until end of dusk).
      #     The Sun spell set and the Moon spell set can not contain any of the same spell.
      #   Notes:
      #     So, in total, you know twice as many Spells.
      #   Downside:
      #     Once you Learn a spell for Day or Night, you can no longer assign it to the other one. Ever.
      
      ~Moonsun Fire~ :          # 2 (1.25 damage + 0.75 striaght up effect)

        Range: 6 meters
        Cooldown: Day/Night (see below)
        HasMixins: true
        Effect: |
          A target makes a Sense Check.
          If it fails, it takes 1d8 + Main Stat Fire Damage and is Crippled (if _day_) or True Damage and is Silenced (if _twilight_).
          It takes half of that Damage if it passes.
          If you use this at _twilight_, you can't use it until _day_, and vice versa.

            Regain up to 3 Mana.
            The Old Ritual must be performed outdoors, in a safe, uncorrupted place untouched by regular folk.
          Downside:
            If you have this Talent, you lose the Shapeshift Ability, and you can't choose upcoming Talents that improve Shapeshift.
          Notes: You can't have more than your maximum amount of Mana.

            Your next Spell (this turn or next) casts twice.
          Upgrade: If you use this with Shapeshift, you can combine into 2 animals, and have both their Abilities and their highest Stats.
          Notes: On the second cast, you can choose different targets, areas, etc (and it ignores Cooldown, Costs, etc). Works on Spells with cast time longer than 1 Action (e.g. Old Ritualist).

          _Value: 3
          A: Passive
          Effect: Whenever you Shapeshift into an animal specific to the current time of day, cast Moonsun Fire for free, ignoring its Cooldown.

#   Coven of the Wicked:          # 2.5
#     Description: |
#       Witch druids use eldritch magic of the nature to bend reality in an unseen way, cast curses and dispell magic.
#       However, this comes at a price, usually of its own sanity and control over the powers.
#       Wiccan Druids believe no one has the right to dictate someone else's spiritual path.
#       As a Wiccan Druid, you oppose fanaticism, opressors and stupidity.
#       Wiccan Druids worship no god, but they do acknowledge their power and they heavily respect nature and the earth.
#       A Wiccan Druid gains the power through not black, nor white eldritch magic.
#       The suggested alignment for Wiccan Druids is True Neutral.

#     Starting Abilities:
    
#       ~Eldritch Spells:
#         A: Passive
#         Effect: |
#             You can also learn Spells from the Eldritch Basic Ability List.
#             If a Spell costs Mana to cast, you can cast it with Blood Magic.
    
#       ~Blood Magic~:    # 1.25
#         A: 0 Actions
#         Cooldown: 1 Turn
#         Effect:
#             Choose an offensive Basic Ability. If it costs nothing, take 6 Damage or otherwise take 6 Damage for each Mana point it costs.
#             Cast that spell regardless of its Cost and Cooldown.
#             You can instead spend 6 Health to cast Black Charm.

#       ~Black Charm~:    # 1.5 but it's ROI
#         A: 0.5 Action
#         Range: 10 meters
#         Cooldown: Once / Adventure
#         Effect: |
#           Choose a target. It must make a Sense Check.
#           If it fails, at the start of your next turn, it is Stunned and takes 2d8 Psychic Damage (or half if it passes).
#         Notes: Ignores Cover.

#           Effect: Channel for 10 minutes in a safe space, uninhabited by regular folk. Regain 3 Mana.
#           Upgrade: If you have this Talent, you can no longer use Shapeshift, whether you used it or not.
#           Notes: Your Mana can't exceed your Max Mana.
        
#         <Druid Animal Companion> : Inherit from Druid
            
#         <Pet Attack>:

#           Cooldown: Once / Adventure
#           Range: 3 meters to edge
#           Effect: |
#             Declare a 6x6 meter area.
#             All Units in that area must pass a Sense Check or instantly make an attack or offensive Ability of its choice, at full strength, on its closest ally.
#           Notes: Monsters can use any of their Abilities that do Damage or Crowd Control, and target them however they want if they are Area Abilities, as long as it hits its closest ally.

#         <Blood Curse>:            # 1 Action + 1 Mana is the follow up you'd do, so 2 Mana-ish
#           A: Half-Action
#           Cooldown: Once / Adventure
#           Effect: |
#             Target a Unit.
#             The next time it would take Damage from any source before your next turn, the Damage is doubled (after Defense).
#           Upgrade: You can only use this on targets that have blood.
#           Notes: Applies to added extra Damage if it's the same type as the base Damage (e.g. Advanced Flank works, but not Smites).

#         <Wicked Animals>:
#           A: 1 Action
#           Cooldown: Once / Adventure
#           Effect: |

#             They appear on the edge of the battlefield, from the wilderness, and they fight for you for up to 1 minute.
#           Notes: Both animals must be of the same type.



# # Fey Druids are people bound to the Fey and to Fey creatures, a whimsical yet chaotic magic.
# # A worshipper of the Forgotten Gods praises Mother Earth, the Stars and possibly gods long forgotten by civilization.
