    You can provide healing and utility to your team with Healing Surge and Speak With Plants, deal flexible damage and Crowd Control with Poison Burst and Mind Blast, and provide buffs to your party with Wild Heart.

Druidic: |
    Druidic is the art of conveying information through wind, soil, bark, etc. Similar to the written version of Thieves' Cant, Druidic is indistinguishable from regular nature, but it contains messages meant for other druids through means like the way bark is growing on a tree, unusual moss formations, unusual winds, etc. These often convey messages like "monster lair", "hidden path", "healing plants ahead", etc.

Starting Abilities Description:
    - Druidcraft: |
        Druids have the ability to create small magical effects that affect plants, animals or just nature.
        You can use the Druidcraft Spell in roleplay scenarios to affect the environment and people.
    - Shapeshift: |
        As a Druid, you can tranform into various animals, both in combat and outside of combat.
        The Shapeshift Spell provides an infinite amount of options to help out your party in any situation!
        You can choose any animal from the Animals list to Shapeshift into, as long as it's not Exotic or non-standard. Each Animal allows you to use its special Ability once per Adventure. You are still only allowed to use that Ability once per Adventure, even if you Shapeshift into that animal twice (the cooldown stays the same).
        Other Druid Talents might allow you to Shapeshift into more unusual beasts.
        Shapeshift is considered a Spell.

        When in Shapeshift form, you always have access to the Animal Attack Ability, which is not considered a Spell.
        Animal Attack is, of course, impaired if you are Crippled.

Starting Abilities:
  ~Druidcraft~:            # Ok
    A: Depends
    Effect: |
      You speak Druidic, an ancient form of conveying information through nature.
      You can create harmless sensory effects or tiny weather effects (6 meters range).
      You can massively speed up the growth of small plants (touch range).
      You can slightly soothe physical pains (with no combat effect) (touch range).
      You can attempt to convey simple ideas to animals and plants (3 meters range) that you would not normally be able to convey.
      You have +3 on rolls for identifying plants.
      You can do these even while Shapeshifted.

  ~Shapeshift~:            # Ok, 0.75
    A: 1 Action
    Cooldown: 2 times / Adventure (see effect)
    Effect: |
      Pick an animal from the Pets and Animals list and instantly transform into it.
      As soon as you Shapeshift, you can perform an Animal Attack!
      
      For Checks, you can choose to use the animal's Stats or your Stats.
      You also gain its exact abilities and Animal Attack (see below), but can't cast Spells.
      Your Health stays the same, but you use that animal's Defense.
      
      Shapeshift ends if you drop to 0 Health, and you Fall.
    Upgrade: |
      At first, you can't fly, even if your animal can. If your animal can fly, you have Proficiency in Jumping and you can glide (you don't take falling Damage).
      From Level 3, you can use this 3 times per Adventure.
      From Level 6, you can use this 4 times per Adventure and you can fly.
      From Level 9, you can use this 5 times per Adventure.
    Notes: |
      You can't make attacks with ranged weapons while Shapeshifted (obviously).
      You choose what items you keep on you when Shapeshifting, and those items are 'merged' into your new form.
      You can turn back into your humanoid form for 0 Actions (on your turn).
      While Shapeshifted, you can speak, but your voice is changed to match your shape (e.g. guttural for lions, high pitched for birds, etc).

  Coven of the Old Ways:        # 1.75
    Description: |
      You worship the sun, the moon and the stars, for only they can truly guide your path.
      Pagan Druids believe no one has the right to dictate someone else's spiritual path.
      As a Pagan Druid, you oppose fanaticism, opressors and stupidity.
      Pagan Druids usually worship no god, but they do acknowledge their power and they heavily respect nature and the earth.
      A Pagan Druid gains the power through not black, nor white magic.
      The suggested alignment for Pagan Druids is True Neutral.


      
    Starting Abilities:
      ~Day Night Cycle~ :       # 0.5
        A: Passive
        Effect: |
          Instead of knowing one set of spells, as normal, you know two: one for the moon, and one for the sun.
          The Moon spells can only be used at night (from end of dusk until start of dawn).
          The Sun spells can only be used at day (from start of dawn until end of dusk).
          The Sun spell set and the Moon spell set can not contain any of the same spell.
        Notes:
          So, in total, you know twice as many Spells.
        Downside:
          Once you Learn a spell for Day or Night, you can no longer assign it to the other one. Ever.
      
      ~Moonsun Fire~ :          # 1.5
        A: Half-Action
        Range: 6 meters
        Cooldown: Day/Night (see below)
        Effect: |
          A target within 6 meters makes a Sense Check.
          If it fails, it takes 1d6 + Main Stat Fire Damage and is Crippled (if day) or True Damage and is Silenced (if night).
          It takes half of that Damage if it passes.
          If you use this at night, you can't use it until day, and vice versa.
        Notes: Ignores Cover.

    Talents:
      Level 3:

          Cooldown: Once / Adventure
          Effect: |
            Regain up to 3 Mana.
            The Old Ritual must be performed outdoors, in a safe, uncorrupted place untouched by regular folk.
          Downside:
            You lose the Shapeshift ability, and you can't choose upcoming Talents that improve Shapeshift.
          Notes: You can't have more than your maximum amount of Mana.
        
        <Improved Moonsun Fire>:    # 1?
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            If day, Moonsun Fire also burns the target for 10% of its total Health as Fire Damage.
            If night, Moonsun Fire heals a target you choose within 6 meters for the same Damage dealt.
        
        <Lycanthropy> :         # 0.5
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            During the night (24:00 to 6:00) you can Shapeshift into a Lycanthrope (see Lycanthrope form) when using Shapeshift.
            
        <Druid Animal Companion> :  # 1
          A: Passive
          Cost: -1 Maximum Mana and -5 Maximum Health
          Effect: |
            You have an animal pet that can fight alongside you, but your Mana pool is permanently decreased by 1, and your total Health by 5.
            Your animal has stats depending on its species. Check out the Pets and Animals page to see its stats!
            Your pet takes its turn at the same time as you do, and always has the same initiative as yours.
            Your pet has 1 Action per turn, which it can use to do its own Abilities.
            Your pet can make normal Checks using using its own Stats.
            Your pet will not stray more than 30 meters away from you in hostile territory.
            All pets have the Pet Attack ability.
          # Pets can't make Opportunity Attacks.
          Upgrade: If your pet drops to 0 Health, it becomes Fallen, like a player. It has no reserve Health, but at any point outside of combat, you (the pet owner) can spend 30 minutes to tend to your pet's wounds and heal it back to full Health.
          Notes: |
            If your pet raises from being Fallen, it has Pet Exhaustion (is Slowed and can only use Pet Attack, but all Pet Attacks have Cover, which is a -2 to the attack).
            Treat your pet like a real companion - give it a name and care for it. If it ever dies, you can spend 2 days looking for another wild animal and taming it to become your new pet.
            
        <Pet Attack>:
            IsSubspell: true
            A: 1 Action (from the pet)
            Effect: |
                The pet melee attacks a target.
                The attack deals 1d6 + 2 Pierce of Slash Damage (your choice).

          A: Half-Action
          Cooldown: Day/Night
          Effect: |
            If it's day, choose a number of Units within 15 meters equal to your Main Stat.
            They must pass a Sense Check or they forget to how to use ranged attacks or spells for 1 turn.
            If it's night, your next Spell (this turn or next turn) casts twice.

  Coven of the Wild:            # 0.5
    Description: You are heavily in touch with nature and with strange creatures, uncommon to the normal folk.
    Starting Abilities:
    
      ~Wild Shape~ :            # 0.5
        A: Passive
        Effect: |
          When you use Shapeshift, you can transform into a combination of 2 animals.
          You take the highest stat from both animals, and you have access to both of their abilities.
        Notes: |
          For example, you could transform into a combination of Bird of Prey and Bear, resulting in a kind of Owlbear, with a lot of health and a lot of Defense! Be creative!
          The animal size is either the larger or the smaller of the two - your choice.
          Even if you Shapeshift into 2 combinations of a same animal, the cooldown of that animal's Ability persists (e.g. you can't use Bear's Maul twice per Adventure, no matter what animal combination you transform into).

    Talents:
      Level 3:
        <Forest Friend>:          # 1
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            You have a Pixie companion, a very small humanoid with wings.
            The Pixie has 10 Defense, 1 HP, 5 Movement Speed.
            It takes its turn at the same time as you and it has a Half-Action on its turn.
            It can't attack with weapons, but it can use scrolls and potions.
            At the start of each Adventure, you can teach it one Spell that costs a Half-Action from any Basic Ability List and it can cast it once for a Half-Action until the next Adventure (ignoring the Cost).
            If the Pixie goes more than 50 meters away from you, it becomes unsummoned (you can summon it back by channeling for 10 minuets).
            The Pixie has Charisma, Sense and Intelligence equal to yours, but its Dexterity is 0 and its Might is -5.
            Decide with your DM whether you or the DM controls the Pixie roleplay-wise.
            Have fun!
          Notes: The Pixie can stay in your backpack or pocket if you don't want it to take Damage.

        <Treesposition>:          # 0.75
          A: 0 Actions or Reaction
          Cooldown: 2 times / Adventure
          Effect: |
            Touch a large or larger piece of wood and choose one of the following:
            1. Teleport near another large or larger piece of wood within 5 meters.
            2. Partially enter the piece of wood, becoming camouflaged. You have +5 Stealth until you exit back to your normal space.
            You can stay like that for up to 1 hour.
            You benefit from Cover while inside a tree.
            As a Reaction, you can use this when you are attacked or right when someone casts a spell (before the roll).
          
        <Exotic Shapeshift>:      # 1
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            You can now Shapeshift into Exotic Animals.
            You can also use Shapeshift to also transform into other people.
            When you want to do this, roll a Deception check.
            This check determines how close you get to the form of that person (12 or more means a perfect copy).
            This copy just mimicks the look of the person, not the voice or personality.
          Notes: |
            You can cast your own spells while transformed into someone else.
            Other people are not considered Animals, so you can't use Wild Shape to transform into a combination of a person and an Animal.

      Level 5:
      
        <Shapeshift Ally>:      # 1.5?
            A: 0 Actions

            Effect: |
                Passively, you get 2 more uses of Shapeshift per Adventure.
                Choose a willing ally within 6 meters and Shapeshift them into an standard animal of your choice.
                They have Animal Attack and all of the animal's Abilities.
                They can cancel it for 0 Actions on their turn.
                
        <Regrowth>:             # 2+ at 30 missing Health
          A: 1 Action
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure
          Range: 5 meters
          Effect: Heal a Unit for 1d8 for each 10 Health it is missing.
        
        <Beastly Stamina>:
          A: Passive
          Effect: For each animal, you gain an extra use of their Abilities that have a Cooldown of Once / Adventure.

  Coven of the Wicked:          # 2.5
    Description: |
      Witch druids use eldritch magic of the nature to bend reality in an unseen way, cast curses and dispell magic.
      However, this comes at a price, usually of its own sanity and control over the powers.
      Wiccan Druids believe no one has the right to dictate someone else's spiritual path.
      As a Wiccan Druid, you oppose fanaticism, opressors and stupidity.
      Wiccan Druids worship no god, but they do acknowledge their power and they heavily respect nature and the earth.
      A Wiccan Druid gains the power through not black, nor white eldritch magic.
      The suggested alignment for Wiccan Druids is True Neutral.

        Cooldown: 1 Turn
        Effect:
            Choose a Basic Ability. If it costs nothing, take 6 Damage or otherwise take 6 Damage for each Mana point it costs.
            Cast that spell regardless of its Cost and Cooldown.
            You can instead spend 6 Health to cast Black Charm.

      ~Black Charm~:    # 1.5 but it's ROI
        A: 0.5 Action
        Range: 10 meters

          If it passes, it takes half of the Damage.

          Upgrade: You can only use this on targets that have blood.
          Notes: Applies to added extra Damage if it's the same type as the base Damage (e.g. Advanced Flank works, but not Smites).
