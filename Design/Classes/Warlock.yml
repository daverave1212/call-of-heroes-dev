  Summoner:
    Description: Lorem "ipsum dolor" sit amet.
    Starting Abilities:

      ~Summon Familiar~ :
        A: 1 Hour
        Effect: |
          You conjure a ritual using various magical materials worth 25 Gold.
          The first time you cast this ritual, you summon a familiar which becomes yours.
          You can choose which type of familiar you want:
          - It can take the shape of a small creature.
          - It can look spectral or look as a normal animal with a slight glow (does not radiate light).
          - You can choose what color it is if it's spectral or what color its glow is.
          Also, choose an element which is bound to it: Fire, Water, Frost, Arcane, Thunder, Earth, Wind, Light or Darkness.
          That becomes your Familiar Element.
          Your familiar comes with a name. Roll for your familiar name on the Familiar Name Table (or your DM will choose one for you).
          You can communicate with your Familiar telepathically.
          The familiar doesn't take turns on its own, but at the same time as you.
          On your turn, your familiar can use its own movement to move, but you must spend your actions for it to take actions.
          If your familiar goes more than 20 meters away from you, it becomes unsummoned.
          If it dies, it becomes unsummoned.
          You can always summon it back with this Ability.
          After your familiar is unsummoned, it needs 24 hours to be summonable back.
          Your familiar has the following stats:
          - Health: 8 + Your Fortitude + 2 * Your Level.
          - Defense: Your Dexterity (minimum 0)
          - Stats and Saves: Same as yours
          - Movement: Same as yours, can't fly, but it can swim at half normal speed

      ~Familiar Pet Attack~ :
        A: 0.5 Actions    # Exactly average
        Cooldown: 1 turn
        Effect: |
          The pet melee attacks a target.
          The attack deals 3d4 + 1 damage (of your pet's elemental type).
        Notes: The attack is against target's Defense.
    
    Other: |  
      As a summoner, you have access to special Familiar Ability.
      You can unlock one Familiar Ability for 2 Skill Points.
      These feats give extra abilities for your Familiar.
      They are considered Maneuvers for you and your pet.
      When creating your character, you also get one of these Abilities for free.
      Some of these abilities require a certain level.

        Range: 3 meters (from your Familiar)
