Class: Warlock
Description: |
  Years of dedicated study have yielded results, though the scholarship of the dark arts is not akin to the arcane. Standing before you is a woman who does not manipulate the strings of magic - no, she destroys them, weaving a tunnel of sorts to an unfathomable source of eldrich energy that pulses ominously around her, stirring unease into your soul. Out of nowhere, she laughs, and her features soften into a kind smile directed at you. Despite society's rejection, she is no monster. She, too, is human, with emotions and heart, however dark it may be.
  Warlocks are practicioners of the occult or outer magic and techniques beyond the normal domain. Using a blade, fell magic and even stealing powers away from the enemies, each warlock has its own source for their powers, by study, persuasiveness or pure chance.
  A warlock is a spellcaster attuned to the unknown and bizarre, who only needs to rest inbetween fights, and every encounter wakes the power in them anew - this time, sleep is not for the wicked.

Quick Note: A warlock is a spellcaster attuned to the unknown and bizarre, who only needs to rest inbetween fights, and every encounter wakes the power in them anew - this time, sleep is not for the wicked.

Difficulty: Medium

Proficiency Requirements: You have a number of Skills equal to your Intelligence.

Proficiencies Description: |
    Warlocks can differ vastly from one individual to another. As such, you can choose to be Skilled in a number of non-combat activities equal to your Intelligence.

    - Eldritch: Deathflame Bolt
    - Elemental: Burning Breath
    - Eldritch: Curse of Weakness
    - Eldritch: Curse of Pain
    - Elemental: Absorb Element

  Recommended Abilities Description: |
    Eldritch Blast is generally a good option for dishing out damage from a safe distance. Consider Deathflame Bolt an upgrade to Eldritch Blast, which you can use when you have Mana and want to deal even more damage!
    Burning Breath is a decent area damage Ability, while Curse of Weakness and Curse of Pain can be very effective against large enemies that take longer to kill.
    Absorb Element will come in handy for protecting your allies. Finally, if you want to use a weapon, Mastery is a great choice, since you will be able to use weapons with Charisma or Intelligence instead of Might or Dexterity.


 

Starting Abilities:

  ~Warlock Mana~:
    _Value: 3
    _ValueComment: Scales hard
    A: Passive
    Effect: |
      Unlike other Classes', all of your Mana regenerates 10 minutes after each Worthy combat encounter (e.g. instead of inbetween Adventures).
      You gain +1 Max Mana only on Levels 3, 6 and 9 (not every Level).
    Notes: For Feats that require you to sacrifice Mana, each Mana counts as 2 sacrificed Mana. Also, for Feats, instead of sacrificing Mana, you could sacrifice 6 Health for each Mana to sacrifice.

  ~Power Source~: # Ok
    A: Passive
    Effect: |
      Your powers have an external source: a demon overlord, an unknowable eldritch entity, a blood corruption, a celestial, etc.
      Pick one more Ability List to know Abilities from, which should match your power source.

Starting Abilities Description:
    - Warlock Mana: |
        Warlock spell casting is somewhat different from other classes.
        Your Mana regenerates inbetween combat encounters. So, for optimal play, use all your Mana every encounter!
    - Power Source: |
        A fae spirit might give you access to the Nature List. An eldritch old god might give you ancient knowledge of the Arcane or Mysticism List, or even Bloodshed. Be creative! And make sure it's approved by the QM.

            Upon reaching 0 or less in all Stats, you become permanently possessed by the energies residing in your Cursewielder Weapon. Each of your Stats becomes a random of 1d8 permanently.
            Reaching 0 or less in all Stats immediately kills you, and both your and your patron's souls are sent to the other plane forever.
          Upgrade: Your soul is sent into a different plane, according to your patronage. From then on, you have the same body, but you are now your patron for all intents and purposes - in mind, personality and soul.

            Throw your Cursewielder Weapon on the ground near you. It becomes a Cursewrought Avatar and immediately grows a body of its own, either ethereal, phantomatic or resembling an animated armor fused with the weapon.
            The Cursewrought Avatar resembles you in all aspects, but can't cast Spells or use Abilities, and can attack only with the Cursewielder Weapon.
            Spells you cast apply to the Damage of your Cursewrought Avatar for Cursewielder (or Curseweave).
          Notes: If you're not holding the Cursewielder Weapon, you obviously can't attack with it.

            Choose a Unit you can see. Pass an Intelligence or Charisma Check at least equal to 5% of its Experience Worth to permanently put it under your control. You can command it telepathically what to and it will do your bidding.
            You can only have one dominated Unit at a time and lasts until the Unit dies, until you dominate another Unit or until you willingly end the curse.
            Also, passively, you gain +3 Sense.
          Upgrade: Failing the Check makes the Unit permanently immune to Hand of Domination and it can sense they resisted an attempt of possession. A dominated Unit has the same combat capabilities and acts like themselves but is essentially a _philosophical zombie_ - they feel no emotion, have no will of their own and manifest little sentiment in their speech and expressiveness. When the Unit stops being dominated, they recall nothing that has happened in that period of time.

        <Whispers of Oblivion>:
          A: 0 Actions
          Effect: |
            Gain a Half-Action this Turn and get -1 in a random Stat permanently.
            Upon reaching 0 or less in all Stats, you become permanently possessed by the energies of your power source. Each of your Stats becomes a random of 1d8 permanently.
            Reaching 0 or less in all Stats immediately kills you, and both your and your patron's souls are sent to the other plane forever.
          Upgrade: Your soul is sent into a different plane, according to your patronage. From then on, you have the same body, but you are now your patron for all intents and purposes - in mind, personality and soul.

        <Mirror Mirror>:

          Cost: 1 Mana
          Duration: 1 hour
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure
          Effect: |
            Summon a clone of yourself on a space within 5 meters. You control the clone and it resembles you perfectly.
            In Combat, the clone acts on your Turn. It has Movement of its own, but will always use its Actions to copy all Basic Abilities and Weapon Attacks you make, on the same target.
          Notes: The clone can't do combat Acts and fine motor skills on its own -- it will always copy yours in parallel.

#   Starting Abilities:

#     ~Summon Familiar~:       # 2
#       A: 1 hour
#       Cooldown: Once / Adventure
#       Effect: |
#         Summon a familiar and choose an element which is bound to it: Fire, Cold, Shock, Light (True) or Scourge.
#         The familiar takes its turn at the same time as you.
#         On your turn, your familiar can use its own movement to move, but you must spend your own Actions for it to take Actions.
#         If it dies or goes more than 30 meters away from you, it becomes unsummoned, and it is also unsummoned inbetween Adventures.
#         The stat block for the Familiar is on the Pets and Animals page.
#       Notes: |
#         It is assumed you always keep your Familiar summoned, unless constrained by time, or in special situations (dictated by the QM).
#         You can choose what your familiar looks like, assuming it is a small creature. Your familiar comes with a name that you or the QM decides.
#         You can communicate with your Familiar telepathically.
#         The Familiar can be classified as a demon, undead, celestial, monstrosity, etc (but not beast or person).
      
#     ~Familiar Pet Attack~:    # Slightly more than 0
#       A: 0.5 Actions
#       Range: 3 meters
#       Cooldown: Once / Turn
#       Effect: |
#         The familiar melee attacks a target.
#         The attack deals 1d8 + (your highest Stat) Damage (of your pet's elemental type).
#       Notes: The attack is against target's Defense, of course.
      
#     ~Familiar Feats~:
#       A: Special
#       Effect: |
#         You also have access to the Familiar Feats.

#       <Dream Walk>:
#         A: Half-Action            # 1
#         Cooldown: Once / Adventure
#         Range: 6 meters
#         Effect: |
#           A Unit must succeed a Sense Check or fall Asleep for 2 turns.
#           Alternatively, you can use Dream Walk on an already sleeping target to alter their dreams to your liking.
#         Notes: A Sleeping Unit wakes up if it takes Damage or other Crowd Control.

#     Level 5:
    
#       <Patron Aspect>:
#         A: 0 Actions
#         Cost: 10 Health
#         Duration: 1 minute
#         Effect: |
#           You take on the shape or a being from your patron's plane until the end of your next turn.
#           You have +2 Intelligence, Sense and Charisma, and your Basic Spells require no mana to cast.
#           After you cast a Basic Spell, it goes on a Once / Adventure Cooldown (can't be used until the next Adventure).
      
#       <Dual Summonation>:         # Makes up for it in 3 turns-ish; 4th turn is definitely worth it; 5th is already bonkers
#         A: Half-Action
#         Cooldown: Once / Adventure
#         Effect: |
#           Summon 2 Dual-Imps at any spaces within 6 meters and choose a target.
#           These 2 imps will cast Chase Bolt and chase their target to death. Otherwise, they don't move from their spot.
#           They last for 10 minutes or until thet target is defeated or they can't attack it.
#           Imps take their turn immediately after you.
#           See the Pets section for the Dual-Imp stats.
#         Notes: |
#           Imps become unsummoned at the start of their turn if the target dies or it becomes untargetable or invisible; Imps will chase around corners, though. Imps don't care about Cover; they attack anyway.
#           Imps aren't very smart, they don't employ tactics.
        
#       <Patron Avatar>:            # 2 turns = 2 Charges
#         A: 0 Actions
#         Cost: 1 Mana
#         Cooldown: Once / Adventure
#         Range: 6 meters
#         Duration: 1 minute
#         Effect: |
#           You summon an Avatar of your patron and become Rooted until the Spell ends.
#           You and the Avatar share Actions.
#           The Avatar can't take Damage or be directly Crowd Controlled, but all Crowd Control you would take is also applies to it.
#           See the Avatar's Stats and Abilities in the Pets sections.
#           Lasts up to 1 minute or until you are Pushed or incapacitated (or until cancelled).
#         Notes: |
#           You can cancel the summon at any point on your turn. The Avatar also ends if it goes more than 30 meters away from you. While the Avatar is summoned, you can't move, except with teleportation Spells.
#           Incapacitated means Stun, Sleep, Paralysis, etc.

#             If it costs Mana, you must spend its Mana.
#           Notes: |
#             Does not work on Passives. The Ability must have 0, a Half-Action or 1 Actions cost.
#             The Cooldown applies to you - you can Power Tap an Ability that's on Cooldown. After you use it, it goes on Cooldown for you, not for your Ally.

# Abilities Description:
#   - Fey Patron: |
#         A wild, outworldly being, heavily magical or in tune with nature, and often outward strange. A Fey Patron often represents an old god of nature or magic, resembled by a magical animal or person.
#         This provides you with the Fey Patron Ability, which gives you one more Race Choice Ability!
#   - Celestian Patron: |
#         A being from a divine plain. Portrayed as angels or divine spirits of life and death.
#         This provides you with the Life Cycle Ability which can function as an emergency heal in combat. This Ability can be used on yourself, too.
#         Note that it simply draws from the Reserve Health pool! It is not Health out of thin air!
#   - Demon or Devil Patron: |
#         A being residing in Hell, an archdevil or lord in hell.
#         This provides the Soul Drain Ability, which gives you a consistent Damage source that can heal you back.
#   - Old God Patron: |
#         An eldritch being of nightmare and terror, whose thoughts, form and wants are incomprehensible to most people
#         This gives you access to one of another Race's Starting Ability.

# Abilities:

#   ~Fey Patron~ :        # 0.5
#     A: Passive
#     Effect: |
#       Your lord is a higher fey creature.
#       Choose one more Racial Feat from your Race.
#     Notes: |
#       The Fey Patron enhances you magically, mutates your arcane flow and transforms you into an unordinarily adapted person.
#       If you are a Dragonsworn, you can instead choose one more Breath shape, and your Breath has both chosen shapes simultanuously (overlapped; the Damage is not doubled).

#   ~Old God Patron~ :    # 0.5
#       A: Passive
#       Effect: |
#         Your lord is an old, slumbering god.
#         You can pick a starting Ability from any other race and have it permanently (from the Starting Abilities, not a Feat).
#       Notes: Eldritch thoughts flow through your mind, infecting you with strange abilities acquired in unfathomable ways.

#   <Soul Drain> :        # 0.75
#     AlignOnWebsite: Right
#     A: Half-Action
#     Cost: 1 Mana
#     Range: 15 meters
#     Effect: |
#       Deal 10 Scourge Damage to a Unit (directly, ).
#       If it dies, you get the Mana back and heal for 5 Health.
#     Upgrade: Corresponds to the Demon Patron.
#     Notes: Through every soul drained, your demon lord feeds, and in return, grants you even more power.
