Class: Warlock
Description: Warlocks are people who made pacts with powerful beings.

Difficulty: Medium

Weapons: You are Trained in 2 Weapon Categories of choice (e.g. 1-Handed Melee, 2-Handed Ranged, Shields, etc).

Proficiency Requirements: You have a number of Proficiencies equal to your Intelligence.

Proficiencies Description: |
    Warlocks can differ vastly from one individual to another. As such, you can choose any proficiencies, in number equal to your Intelligence, but do not get any specific Proficiency.

  Other: All Warlock-specific Abilities are considered Spells.
  Known Basic Abilities: 2 + Your Intelligence
  BaseKnownSpells: 2
  Basic Ability Lists:
    - Elemental
    - Eldritch

  Recommended Basic Abilities:
    - Eldritch: Eldritch Blast
    - Eldritch: Deathfire Bolt
    - Elemental: Burning Breath
    - Eldritch: Curse of Weakness
    - Eldritch: Curse of Pain
    - Elemental: Absorb Element

  Recommended Abilities Description: |
    Eldritch Blast is generally a good option for dishing out damage from a safe distance. Consider Deathfire Bolt an upgrade to Eldritch Blast, which you can use when you have Mana and want to deal even more damage!
    Burning Breath is a decent area damage Ability, while Curse of Weakness and Curse of Pain can be very effective against large enemies that take longer to kill.
    Absorb Element will come in handy for protecting your allies. Finally, if you want to use a weapon, Mastery is a great choice, since you will be able to use weapons with Charisma or Intelligence instead of Might or Dexterity.


 

Starting Abilities:

  ~Warlock Mana~:
    _Value: 3
    _ValueComment: Scales hard
    A: Passive
    Effect: |
      Unlike other Classes', all of your Mana regenerates 10 minutes after each Worthy combat encounter (e.g. instead of inbetween Adventures).
      You gain +1 Max Mana only on Levels 3, 6 and 9 (not every Level).
    Notes: For Feats that require you to sacrifice Mana, each Mana counts as 2 sacrificed Mana. For example, MC - Shaman will cost only 1 Max Mana and 2 Max Health for you. Or you can sacrifice 1 Mana to gain multiple feats worth 2 Mana (e.g. sacrifice 1 Mana to get Magic Initiate and Adaptation).

  ~Power Source~: # Ok
    A: Passive
    Effect: |
      Your powers have an external source: a demon overlord, an unknowable eldritch entity, a blood corruption, a celestial, etc.
      Pick one more Ability List to know Abilities from, which should match your power source.

Starting Abilities Description:
    - Warlock Mana: |
        Warlock spell casting is somewhat different from other classes.
        Your Mana regenerates inbetween combat encounters. So, for optimal play, use all your Mana every encounter!
    - Power Source: |
        A fae spirit might give you access to the Nature List. An eldritch old god might give you ancient knowledge of the Arcane or Mysticism List, or even Bloodshed. Be creative! And make sure it's approved by the GM.

          Notes: E.g. if the enemy has 10 Health, and you deal 16 Damage, heal an ally for 6 Health.

      Level 9:

        <Final Word>:
          A: Passive
          Effect: When you have exactly 1 Mana, and you cast a Spell that cost 1 Mana, that Spell casts twice (for free).

#         Effect: |
#           Summon 2 Dual-Imps at any spaces within 6 meters and choose a target.
#           These 2 imps will cast Chase Bolt and chase their target to death. Otherwise, they don't move from their spot.
#           They last for 10 minutes or until thet target is defeated or they can't attack it.
#           Imps take their turn immediately after you.
#           See the Pets section for the Dual-Imp stats.
#         Notes: |
#           Imps become unsummoned at the start of their turn if the target dies or it becomes untargetable or invisible; Imps will chase around corners, though. Imps don't care about Cover; they attack anyway.
#           Imps aren't very smart, they don't employ tactics.

#             Cast an Ability one of your Allies has (with that ability's Actions and Costs and your modifiers).
#             If it costs Mana, you must spend its Mana.
#           Notes: |
#             Does not work on Passives. The Ability must have 0, a Half-Action or 1 Actions cost.
#             The Cooldown applies to you - you can Power Tap an Ability that's on Cooldown. After you use it, it goes on Cooldown for you, not for your Ally.

# Abilities Description:
#   - Fey Patron: |
#         A wild, outworldly being, heavily magical or in tune with nature, and often outward strange. A Fey Patron often represents an old god of nature or magic, resembled by a magical animal or person.
#         This provides you with the Fey Patron Ability, which gives you one more Race Choice Ability!
#   - Celestial Patron: |
#         A being from a divine plain. Portrayed as angels or divine spirits of life and death.
#         This provides you with the Life Cycle Ability which can function as an emergency heal in combat. This Ability can be used on yourself, too.
#         Note that it simply draws from the Reserve Health pool! It is not Health out of thin air!
#   - Demon or Devil Patron: |
#         A being residing in Hell, an archdevil or lord in hell.
#         This provides the Soul Drain Ability, which gives you a consistent Damage source that can heal you back.
#   - Old God Patron: |
#         An eldritch being of nightmare and terror, whose thoughts, form and wants are incomprehensible to most people
#         This gives you access to one of another Race's Starting Ability.

# Abilities:

#   ~Fey Patron~ :        # 0.5
#     A: Passive
#     Effect: |
#       Your lord is a higher fey creature.
#       Choose one more Racial Feat from your Race.
#     Notes: |
#       The Fey Patron enhances you magically, mutates your arcane flow and transforms you into an unordinarily adapted person.
#       If you are a Dragonborn, you can instead choose one more Breath shape, and your Breath has both chosen shapes simultanuously (overlapped; the Damage is not doubled).

#   ~Old God Patron~ :    # 0.5
#       A: Passive
#       Effect: |
#         Your lord is an old, slumbering god.
#         You can pick a starting Ability from any other race and have it permanently (from the Starting Abilities, not a Feat).
#       Notes: Eldritch thoughts flow through your mind, infecting you with strange abilities acquired in unfathomable ways.
