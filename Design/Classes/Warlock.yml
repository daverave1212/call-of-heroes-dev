  Basic Ability Lists:
    - Elemental
    - Mysticism
    - Eldritch

  Recommended Basic Abilities:
    - Eldritch: Eldritch Blast
    - Eldritch: Deathfire Bolt
    - Elemental: Burning Breath
    - Eldritch: Curse of Weakness
    - Eldritch: Curse of Pain
    - Elemental: Absorb Element
    - Mysticism: Mastery

  Recommended Abilities Description: |
    Eldritch Blast is generally a good option for dishing out damage from a safe distance. Consider Deathfire Bolt an upgrade to Eldritch Blast, which you can use when you have Mana and want to deal even more damage!
    Burning Breath is a decent area damage Ability, while Curse of Weakness and Curse of Pain can be very effective against large enemies that take longer to kill.
    Absorb Element will come in handy for protecting your allies. Finally, if you want to use a weapon, Mastery is a great choice, since you will be able to use weapons with Charisma or Intelligence instead of Might or Dexterity.


 

Starting Abilities:

  ~Power Tap~ :         # 1 Charges (can use class spells)
    A: Depends
    Cost: Depends
    Cooldown: Once / Adventure
    Effect: |
      Cast an ability one of your Allies has (with that ability's Actions and Costs and your modifiers).

Starting Abilities Description:
    - Spell Casting: |
        Warlock spell casting is somewhat different from other classes.

        Try to clone strong Abilities from your teammates that don't take up Mana.
        Talent Abilities are generally stronger than standard Basic Ability List Abilities.
        
# Utility
# Utility + Healing

# Idea: Each subclass is based on a patron?

Abilities Description:
  - Fey Patron: |
        A wild, outworldly being, heavily magical or in tune with nature, and often outward strange. A Fey Patron often represents an old god of nature or magic, resembled by a magical animal or humanoid.
        This provides you with the Fey Patron Ability, which gives you one more Race Choice Ability!
  - Celestial Patron: |
        A being from a divine plain. Portrayed as angels or divine spirits of life and death.
        This provides you with the Life Cycle Ability which can function as an emergency heal in combat. This Ability can be used on yourself, too.
        Note that it simply draws from the Reserve Health pool! It is not Health out of thin air!
  - Demon or Devil Patron: |
        A being residing in Hell, an archdevil or lord in hell.
        This provides the Soul Drain Ability, which gives you a consistent Damage source that can heal you back.
  - Old God Patron: |
        An eldritch being of nightmare and terror, whose thoughts, form and wants are incomprehensible to most people
        This gives you access to one of another Race's Starting Ability.

Abilities:

  ~Fey Patron~ :        # 0.5
    A: Passive
    Effect: |
      Your lord is a higher fey creature.
      Choose one more Racial Feat from your Race.
    Notes: |
      The Fey Patron enhances you magically, mutates your arcane flow and transforms you into an unordinarily adapted person.
      If you are a Dragonborn, you can instead choose one more Breath shape, and your Breath has both chosen shapes simultanuously (overlapped; the Damage is not doubled).

  ~Old God Patron~ :    # 0.5
      A: Passive
      Effect: |
        Your lord is an old, slumbering god.
        You can pick a starting Ability from any other race and have it permanently (from the Starting Abilities, not a Feat).
      Notes: Eldritch thoughts flow through your mind, infecting you with strange abilities acquired in unfathomable ways.

  <Life Cycle> :        # 0.5
    AlignOnWebsite: Right
    A: 0 Actions

    A: Half-Action
    Cost: 1 Mana

      If it dies, you get the Mana back and heal for 5 Health.
    Upgrade: Corresponds to the Demon Patron.
    Notes: Through every soul drained, your demon lord feeds, and in return, grants you even more power.

  Hexblade:
    Description: Ha! Lorem ipsum!!
    Starting Abilities:

      ~Sentient Weapon~ :
        A: Special
        Effect: |
          You have a Hexblade Weapon, inside which your patron's avatar lies, either possessing the weapon, being trapped inside it or using it as a means of communication with you.
          Pick any weapon type (e.g. Shortsword, Longbow, Pike, etc), and it becomes your Hexblade Weapon.
          You can customize your weapon's personality, voice, the way it looks. Talk to your GM about this.
          You are automatically considered Trained in your Hexblade Weapon.

      ~Hexblade~ :      # 1.75
        A: Passive
        Effect: After you cast an offensive Spell, your next Hexblade Weapon attack deals +1d6 Damage. Also, instead of adding Dexterity of Might, you can add your Main Stat to attacks with your Hexblade Weapon.
        Upgrade: |
          Reposess: By spending 1 hour, you can transfer the entity posessing your Hexblade weapon into another weapon. That new weapon becomes your Hexblade Weapon, and the old one is destroyed.
        Notes: Offensive means that it deals Damage or applies hard Crowd Control (anything better than Slow and creating Hard Terrain).

          Cost: 1 Mana

            Count the Units within 3 meters of you (except you).
            They are all attacked for 1d6 + (the number of Units) Force Damage (against Defense).
          Notes: E.g. if this affects 2 Units, it deals 3d6. If it affects 3 Units, it deals 4d6. 4 Units - 5d6. And so on.

    Description: LOREM! Dolor, dolor!
    Starting Abilities:

      ~Power Overwhelming~:     # 2?
        A: Passive
        Effect: |
          All your Eldritch Basic Spells have their dice increased by 1 tier.
        Notes: |
          Increasing dice by 1 tier means, for example, d6 become d8, or d10 become d12. D12's and d20's don't increase.

          If it dies or goes more than 30 meters away from you, it becomes unsummoned, and it is also unsummoned inbetween Adventures.
          The stat block for the Familiar is on the Pets and Animals page.

          Range: 6 meters
          Effect: |

        <Patron Aspect>:
          A: 0 Actions
          Cost: 10 Health

          Cooldown: Once / Adventure
          Effect: |
            Summon 2 Dual-Imps at any spaces within 6 meters and choose a target.

            They last for 10 minutes or until thet target is defeated or they can't attack it.
            Imps take their turn immediately after you.
            See the Pets section for the Dual-Imp stats.
          Notes: |
            Imps become unsummoned at the start of their turn if the target dies or it becomes untargetable or invisible; Imps will chase around corners, though. Imps don't care about Cover; they attack anyway.
            Imps aren't very smart, they don't employ tactics.
          
        <Patron Avatar>:            # 2 turns = 2 Charges
