# Idea: Each subclass is based on a patron?

Abilities Description:
  - Fey Patron: |
        A wild, outworldly being, heavily magical or in tune with nature, and often outward strange. A Fey Patron often represents an old god of nature or magic, resembled by a magical animal or humanoid.
        This provides you with the Fey Patron Ability, which gives you one more Race Choice Ability!
  - Celestial Patron: |
        A being from a divine plain. Portrayed as angels or divine spirits of life and death.
        This provides you with the Life Cycle Ability which can function as an emergency heal in combat. This Ability can be used on yourself, too.
        Note that it simply draws from the Reserve Health pool! It is not Health out of thin air!
  - Demon or Devil Patron: |
        A being residing in Hell, an archdevil or lord in hell.
        This provides the Soul Drain Ability, which gives you a consistent Damage source that can heal you back.
  - Old God Patron: |
        An eldritch being of nightmare and terror, whose thoughts, form and wants are incomprehensible to most people
        This gives you access to one of another Race's Starting Ability.

    Notes: |
      Lore-wise, the Fey Patron enhances you magically, mutates your arcane flow and transforms you into an unordinarily adapted person.
      If you are a Dragonborn, you can instead choose one more Breath shape, and your Breath has both chosen shapes simultanuously (overlapped).

    Description: Lorem "ipsum dolor" sit amet.
    Starting Abilities:

      ~Summon Familiar~:       # 1
        A: 1 Hour
        Effect: |
          You conjure a ritual for 1 hour.
          The first time you cast this ritual, you summon a familiar which becomes yours.
          You can choose what your familiar looks like, assuming it is a small creature.
          Also, choose an element which is bound to it: Fire, Water, Frost, Arcane, Thunder, Earth, Wind, Light or Darkness. That becomes your Familiar's Element.
          Your familiar comes with a name that the GM decides.
          The familiar doesn't take turns on its own, but at the same time as you.
          On your turn, your familiar can use its own movement to move, but you must spend your own Actions for it to take actions.
          If your familiar goes more than 30 meters away from you, it becomes unsummoned.
          If it dies, it becomes unsummoned.
          You can always summon it back with this Ability.
          The stat block for the Familiar is on the Pets and Animals page.
        Notes: |
          You can communicate with your Familiar telepathically.
          The Familiar can be classified as a demon, undead, celestial, monstrosity, etc (but not beast or humanoid).
        
      ~Familiar Pet Attack~:    # Slightly more than 0
        A: 0.5 Actions
        Range: 3 meters
        Cooldown: 1 turn
        Effect: |
          The familiar melee attacks a target.
          The attack deals 1d12 + Main Stat damage (of your pet's elemental type).
        Notes: The attack is against target's Defense, of course.
        
      ~Familiar Feats~:
        A: Special
        Effect: |
          You also have access to the Familiar Feats.
          You can choose one Familiar Feat to get for free.

        <Dream Walk>:
          A: Half-Action            # 1
          Cooldown: Long Rest
          Range: 6 meters
          Effect: |
            A Unit must pass a Sense Check or fall Asleep for 2 turns.
            Alternatively, you can use Dream Walk on an already sleeping target to alter their dreams to your liking.
          Notes: A Sleeping Unit wakes up if it takes damage or other Crowd Control.

      Level 5:
      
        <Patron Aspect>:
          A: 0 Actions
          Cost: 10 Health
          Effect: |
            You take on the shape or a being from your patron's plane until the end of your next turn.
            You have +2 Defense, +2 Main Stat, and your Generic Spells require no mana to cast.
            After you cast a Generic Spell for free, it goes on a Long Rest Cooldown.
        
        <Dual Summonation>:         # Makes up for it in 3 turns-ish; 4th turn is definitely worth it; 5th is already bonkers
          A: Half-Action
          Cooldown: Long Rest
          Effect: |
            Summon 2 Dual-Imps at any spaces within 6 meters and choose a target.
            These 2 imps will cast Chase Bolt and chase their target to death. Otherwise, they don't move from their spot.
            They last for 10 minutes or until thet target is defeated or they can't attack it.
            Imps take their turn immediately after you.
            See the Pets section for the Dual-Imp stats.
          Notes: |
            Imps become unsummoned at the start of their turn if the target dies or it becomes untargetable or invisible; Imps will chase around corners, though. Imps don't care about Cover; they attack anyway.
            Imps aren't very smart, they don't employ tactics.
          
        
        <Patron Avatar>:            # 2 turns = 2 Charges
          A: 0 Actions
          Cost: 1 Mana
          Cooldown: Long Rest

          Effect: |
            You summon an Avatar of your patron.
            While the Avatar is summoned, you can't move, except with teleportation Spells.
            You and the Avatar share Actions and you must use at least a Half-Action with it every turn, otherwise it becomes unsummoned.
            The Avatar can't take damage or be directly Crowd Controlled, but all Crowd Control you would take is redirected to it.
            See the Avatar's Stats and Abilities in the Pets sections.
            Lasts up to 1 minute or until you are Stunned, Silenced, put to Sleep, etc or physically moved from place.
          Notes: You can cancel the summon at any point on your turn. The Avatar also ends if it goes more than 30 meters away from you.
