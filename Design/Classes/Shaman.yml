    ~Proficiency in Occultism~: Inherit

  BaseKnownSpells: 2
  
  Basic Ability Lists:
    - Bloodshed
    - Nature
    - Mysticism

  Recommended Basic Abilities:
    - Bloodshed: Chilling Shout
    - Mysticism: Invigorate
    - Bloodshed: Panic Lash
    - Mysticism: Confusion
    - Mysticism: Restoration
    - Mysticism: Mastery

  Recommended Abilities Description: |
    Chilling Shout is a great way to spend Mana to deal damage. Invigorate will keep your party alive - make sure you keep them at full health! Panic Lash will come in handy against enemies that heal, or in case you ever need just a Half-Action. Confusion is a very good source of distruption, and Restoration will bring your party back from being Fallen with no repercussions.
    The last suggestion is Mastery. This one is very situational, as it allows you to use your Sense or Charisma to attack with weapons instead of Might or Dexterity. If you already have high Might and Dexterity, consider getting something else instead. A good recommendation is Speak With Animals for some extra utility for your group.

Other: |
  As a Shaman, you have a spirit animal that represents you.
  Choose one of the following spirit animals.
  You will permanently gain the bonuses of that spirit animal.

Starting Abilities Description:
  - Animal Spirit: |
      As a Shaman, you have a spirit animal that you choose when you create your character.
      This spirit animal accompanies you spiritually.
      The spirit animal is generally invisible and manifests as a ghostly presence when you use the Ability specific to it.
  

Starting Abilities: 
  ~Echoes~:                   # 2 Mana
    A: Passive
    Cooldown: Each Spell can only echo once per Combat
    HasMixins: true
    Effect: |
      After you cast a Basic Ability you spent Mana on, if you roll maximum on at least one ^immediate^ Damage or Healing die, the Ability _echoes_ and you cast it again (for 0 Actions), but all Damage or Healing it does is reduced by 50%.
      The _echoed_ Ability can't affect the same target(s) or area.
    Notes: |
      Immediate means not delayed, not over time, etc (e.g. Scorching Rays, Healing Surge, Mind Blast are immediate; Explosion Rune, Curse of Pain, etc are not immediate). _Echoing_ can only happen if you roll maximum on the initial cast (when you spend the Mana), even if there's more Damage or Healing later (e.g. Crackling Lightning _echoes_ only if you roll maximum the moment you cast it).
      If the area overlaps the initial area, the overlapped part has no effect. If it hits the same target(s), it has no effect on them.
      Take the Ability text as it is - _echoing_ Lightning Storm repeats the initial Damage, but you'd have to spend another 1 Action to retrigger the second Lightning Storm.
      The GM has the word on whether something is possible.

          Touch another ally.
          Whenever either of you makes a Check, add the higher bonus from either of you instead of their normal Check bonus.
        Notes: This does apply to Proficiencies - if your bonded ally has Proficiency in something, you also add the ally's Level, as it would normally make sense.

        A: Passive
        HasMixins: true

            You become a bodyless soul for up to 8 hours and enter a willing ally.
            While inside the ally's body, you can communicate with them mentally, and only they can see you.
            You can slightly peek outside of their body, and move your arms, upper body and head as if you were a ghost originating from that ally's body.
            {Diamond} You can't move yourself, but you always move with that ally.
            {Diamond} You can't do any physical actions (because you are a ghost and can't touch anything or anyone).
            {Diamond} You can cast spells normally. 
            {Diamond} You follow your own Initiative in combat.
            {Diamond} You can't take Damage or Crowd Control from external sources, but you feel every body sensation that ally feels.

          Effect: |
            You undergo an isolated, personal and mind-altering ritual with a willing non-Warlock Player Character at a campfire, and using incense, smoke and special herbs.
            The ally must make a Sense Check (against your Spell Grade).
            If it passes, its Max Mana permanently increases by 1, and gets +2 to all Checks for the rest of the Adventure.
            If it fails, it takes 1d8 Psychic Damage and gets -1 to all Checks for the rest of the Adventure.
          Upgrade: |
            You can perform this ritual as many times as you want per Adventure until you succeed once. It costs you 1 Mana (not Max Mana), which is spent when the ally passes the ritual.

            Choose one option from Storm, Wind, Heat, Cold.

          Notes: |
            If both are Damaged/Healed at the same time, this only applies once and you choose which takes the Damage/Healing of the other.
            The extra Damage of Smites, Ambush, etc over an attack counts as the same Damage source.

        Notes: |
          The GM might not roll Damage for monsters, and instead take the average - even if they take the average, that counts as a roll.

            A Unit within 6 meters makes a Sense Check.
            If it fails, it takes 2d6 Psychic Damage at the start of your every turn for 1 minute, and for its next turn, you can choose that enemy's Acts as long as it would seem reasonable to that enemy (decide with your GM).
            Epic Monsters can not be controlled; they only take the Damage.
          Notes: For example, you can make a goblin run or recklessly attack one of your party members. But you can't make a guard jump off a cliff, because that's not what it would normally do.

            When you create it, roll 1d4 to determine its effect.

            Sharp bones grow from the area (occupying 1x1 meters each).
            When a Unit steps on a Sharp Bone, it directly takes 1d8 Pierce Damage and loses 1 meter of its remaining speed.
            The bone then shatters.

            Declare a square area with a diameter equal to the Health spent.
            Undead hands appear in that area and make it Hard Terrain.
            At the start of your next turn, summon a number of Zombies equal to half the Health spent, each wherever you choose in that area.
            They take their turn the same time as you and you can command them to do move and attack (they can't do Default Moves or use items).
            They have 4 Speed, 1 Health, 2 Defense and fail all Checks.
            Each can attack for 1d4 - 1 Necrotic Damage, but ignore Defense.
            Zombies last for up to 10 minutes.
