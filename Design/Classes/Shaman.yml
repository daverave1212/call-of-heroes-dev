  Basic Ability Lists:
    - Bloodshed
    - Nature
    - Mysticism

  Recommended Basic Abilities:
    - Bloodshed: Chilling Shout
    - Mysticism: Invigorate
    - Bloodshed: Panic Lash
    - Mysticism: Confusion
    - Mysticism: Restoration
    - Mysticism: Mastery

  Recommended Abilities Description: |
    Chilling Shout is a great way to spend Mana to deal damage. Invigorate will keep your party alive - make sure you keep them at full health! Panic Lash will come in handy against enemies that heal, or in case you ever need just a Half-Action. Confusion is a very good source of distruption, and Restoration will bring your party back from being Fallen with no repercussions.
    The last suggestion is Mastery. This one is very situational, as it allows you to use your Sense or Charisma to attack with weapons instead of Might or Dexterity. If you already have high Might and Dexterity, consider getting something else instead. A good recommendation is Speak With Animals for some extra utility for your group.

Other: |
  As a Shaman, you have a spirit animal that represents you.
  Choose one of the following spirit animals.
  You will permanently gain the bonuses of that spirit animal.

Starting Abilities Description:
  - Animal Spirit: |
      As a Shaman, you have a spirit animal that you choose when you create your character.
      This spirit animal accompanies you spiritually.
      The spirit animal is generally invisible and manifests as a ghostly presence when you use the Ability specific to it.
  

Starting Abilities: 
  ~Echoes~:                   # 2 Mana
    A: Passive
    Cooldown: Each Spell can only echo once per Combat
    HasMixins: true
    Effect: |
      After you cast a Basic Ability you spent Mana on, if you roll maximum on at least one ^immediate^ Damage or Healing die, the Ability _echoes_ and you cast it again (for 0 Actions), but all Damage or Healing it does is reduced by 50%.
      The _echoed_ Ability can't affect the same target(s) or area.
    Notes: |
      Immediate means not delayed, not over time, etc (e.g. Scorching Rays, Healing Surge are immediate; Explosion Rune, Curse of Pain, etc are not immediate). _Echoing_ can only happen if you roll maximum on the initial cast (when you spend the Mana), even if there's more Damage or Healing later (e.g. Crackling Lightning _echoes_ only if you roll maximum the moment you cast it).
      If the area overlaps the initial area, the overlapped part has no effect. If it hits the same target(s), it has no effect on them.
      Take the Ability text as it is - _echoing_ Lightning Storm repeats the initial Damage, but you'd have to spend another 1 Action to retrigger the second Lightning Storm.
      The GM has the word on whether something is possible.

        A: 1 Action
        Cooldown: Once / Adventure
        Effect: |
          Touch another ally.
          Whenever either of you makes a Check, add the higher bonus from either of you instead of the normal Check bonus.
          You can do this once per Adventure, and lasts for the rest of the Adventure.
        Notes: This does apply to Proficiencies - if your bonded ally has Proficiency in something, you also add the ally's Level, as it would normally make sense.

      ~Mind Sight~ :                # 1
        A: 1 Action
        Cooldown: Once / Adventure
        Range: 15 meters
        Effect: |
          A Unit you can clearly see must pass a Sense Check or be Blinded and take 3d6 Damage, or half of that if it passes.
          Then, if you succeeded, you can then see through the target's eyes until you make another action or move.
          If the target is unaware and it rolls 7 or less (total), it doesn't notice what just happened.
        Notes: |
          You can choose not to deal the Damage for this ability and not to Blind the target.
          You see more and more blurry as the target gets farther away. At 10 kilometers, the spell breaks.

    Talents:
      Level 3:
      
        <Mind Link>:                # 1

          Cooldown: Once / Adventure
          Effect: |
            Establish a mind connection with a willing ally.
            For the rest of the Adventure, you can talk to eachother telepathically.
            Additionally, the ally can do Mind Sight once until your next Adventure.

        <Dream Walk>:
          A: 0.5 Actions            # 1
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure
          Range: 6 meters
          Effect: |
            A Unit must pass a Sense Check or fall Asleep for 2 turns.
            Alternatively, you can use Dream Walk on an already sleeping target to alter their dreams to your liking.
          Notes: A Sleeping Unit wakes up if it takes Damage or other Crowd Control.


      Level 5:
      
        <Regrowth>: Inherit from Druid
    
        <Strong Spirited>:  # Hmm
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            Spirit Bond now works for Attack bonuses and Spell Grades too.
            For your every 3rd Spell you cast that has a Once / Adventure Cooldown, if it's single target Spell, the target must pass a Sense Check or be Fumbling.

        <Psyche Tether>:    # 2 Charges at 8 Damage
          A: 0 Actions
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure
          Effect: |
            Place a tether on 2 Units within 10 meters of you.
            The next time one of them takes Damage, the other one takes the Damage (directly, ignoring Defense) as well as Psychic Damage.
          Notes: |
            If both are Damaged at the same time, this only applies once and you choose which takes the Damage of the other.
            The extra Damage of Smites, Ambush, etc count over an attack counts as the same Damage source.
            If another case is ambiguous, the DM makes the choice if it counts.

    Description: Lorem, ipsum, snitel, dolor!
  
    Starting Abilities:
    
      ~Spirit Guides~:     # 0.5
        A: Special
        Effect: |
          At the start of every Adventure, roll 1d6 and remember what you rolled.
          These dice are called Guide Dice.
          You can freely consume one Guide Dice and add it to any Check you or an ally makes.
        Upgrade: At levels 2, 5 and 8, you gain one more Guide Die.

      ~Hex and Curse~:        # 1?
        A: 0.5 Actions
        Cooldown: 2 uses / Adventure
        Effect: |
          Declare either an ally (or yourself) or an enemy within 6 meters.
          If it's an enemy, it must pass a Sense Check or have all its Damage dice downgraded 1 tier for 1 minute.
          If it's an ally, it must pass a Sense Check to be healed for 1d12, or half of that if it fails.
          Downgrading can stack (you can downgrade an enemy's dice multiple times).
        Notes: |
          Downgrading dice by 1 tier means, for example, d6 become d4, or d12 become d10.
          D4's and d20's don't decrease.
          If you target an Epic Monster, the tier downgrade happens to its first turn every round only.
        
    Talents:
      Level 3:

          A: 1 Action
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure
          Range: 6 meters
          Effect: |
            A Unit within 6 meters makes a Sense Check.
            If it fails, it takes 2d6 Psychic Damage at the start of your turn for 1 minute and for its next turn, you can choose that enemy's actions as long as it would seem reasonable to that enemy (decide with your DM).
            Epic Monsters can not be controlled; they only take the Damage.
          Notes: For example, you can make a goblin run or recklessly attack one of your party members. But you can't make a guard jump off a cliff, because that's not what it would normally do.

        <Incorporeal Form> :
          HasMixins: true
          A: 0 Actions
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure

            You become a bodyless soul for up to 8 hours and enter a willing ally.
            While inside the ally's body, you can communicate with them mentally, and only they can see you.
            You can slightly peek outside of their body, and move your arms, upper body and head as if you were a ghost originating from that ally's body.
            {Diamond} You can't move yourself, but you always move with that ally.
            {Diamond} You can't do any physical actions (because you are basically a ghost and can't touch anything or anyone).
            {Diamond} You can cast spells as normal. 
            {Diamond} You follow your own Initiative in combat.
            {Diamond} You can't take Damage from external sources, but you feel every body sensation that ally feels.
            You can freely exit their body and revert back to your physical self using 0 Actions.

            You gain 1 more Guide Die.
            You can now do the following with Guide Dice:
            {Diamond} Add to another ally's Damage roll
            {Diamond} Subtract from an enemy's Damage roll
            {Diamond} Add to another ally's Resist Check
            {Diamond} Subtract from an enemy's Resist Check
            You can only use 1 Guide Die at a time.

          Effect: |
            Choose a 3x3 meter zone.
            Undead hands appear in that zone and make it Hard Terrain.
            At the start of your next turn, use one of your Guide Dice to summon that many Zombies wherever you choose in that zone.
            They take their turn the same time as you and you can command them to do move and attack (they can't do Default Moves or use items).
            They have 4 Speed, 1 Health, 3 Defense and fail all Checks.
            Each can attack for 1d4 - 1 Necrotic Damage (directly, ignoring Defense).
            Zombies last up to 10 minutes.

        <Bone Mass>:           # 1.75
          A: 0.5 Actions

          Range: 6 meters to edge
          Effect: |
            Spend one Guide Die and declare a square area.
            The diameter of the area is equal to the spent Guide Die.
            Sharp bones occupying 1x1 meters each grow from the area.
            When a Unit steps on a Sharp Bone, it directly takes 1d8 Pierce Damage and loses 1 meter of its remaining speed.
            The bone then shatters.
