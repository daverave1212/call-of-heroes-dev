Class: Shaman
Description: |
  A storm gathers strength on the horizon - a sign of the wrathful spirits that stir with agitation. The seer gazes upon you, eyes as white and cold as frost, peering beyond the mundane realm into the shadowed depths of your soul. "You are not prepared," he intones. Another member of the tribe emerges, draped in a hide of a wolf, arms brown and blue inscribed with unknown marks and a hefty axe resting upon his back. "The ritual must continue" he declares. "We are but frail beings, in these mortal vessels, and the spirit realm draws close. Alone, we stand defenseless."
  Shamans are spirit guides and warriors of the other realm who often engage in ancient rituals and soul magic beyond most mortals' comprehension. Through body, mind or soul, each shaman finds their way to commune with or destroy the spirits haunting or aiding the lands.
  A shaman is a fierce warrior and a powerful spellcaster who taps into their ancestry to empower magic, survive inhumane conditions, or even engage in occult practices to better flow with the world around them.

Quick Note: A shaman is a fierce warrior and a powerful spellcaster who taps into their ancestry to empower magic, survive inhumane conditions, or even engage in occult practices to better flow with the world around them.

Difficulty: Medium

Proficiency Requirements: You have Skilled in Occultism and have a number of extra non-combat Skills equal to your Intelligence or Sense, whichever is higher.

Proficiencies:
    ~Skilled in Occultism~: Inherit

Proficiencies Description: |
    No two shamans are alike - each specializes in a different type of magic, with different customs and personalized rituals and beliefs. As such, you are Skilled in Occultism, and any extra Skills you need based, on your intelligence.


Level Up:
  Every Level: 
    Health: 4

  
Spellcasting:
  Type: Mana-based
  SpellsOrAbilities: Spell

  Spell Grade: 6 + Sense, Intelligence or Charisma, whichever is higher
  Change: You can change your known Spells and Talents inbetween Adventures.
  Other: All Shaman-specific Abilities are considered Spells (unless stated otherwise).

  Mana:
    Amount: 2
    Regain: You regain all Mana back inbetween Adventures.

  Known Basic Abilities: 2 + Intelligence (minimum 1)
  
  BaseKnownSpells: 2
  
  Basic Ability Lists:
    - Bloodshed
    - Nature
    - Mysticism

  Recommended Basic Abilities:
    - Bloodshed: Chilling Shout
    - Mysticism: Invigorate
    - Bloodshed: Panic Lash
    - Mysticism: Confusion
    - Mysticism: Restoration
    - Mysticism: Mastery

  Recommended Abilities Description: |
    Chilling Shout is a great way to spend Mana to deal damage. Invigorate will keep your party alive - make sure you keep them at full health! Panic Lash will come in handy against enemies that heal, or in case you ever need just a Half-Action. Confusion is a very good source of distruption, and Restoration will bring your party back from being Fallen with no repercussions.
    The last suggestion is Mastery. This one is very situational, as it allows you to use your Sense or Charisma to attack with weapons instead of Might or Dexterity. If you already have high Might and Dexterity, consider getting something else instead. A good recommendation is Speak With Animals for some extra utility for your group.

Other: |
  As a Shaman, you have a spirit animal that represents you.
  Choose one of the following spirit animals.
  You will permanently gain the bonuses of that spirit animal.

Starting Abilities Description:
  - Animal Spirit: |
      As a Shaman, you have a spirit animal that you choose when you create your character.
      This spirit animal accompanies you spiritually.
      The spirit animal is generally invisible and manifests as a ghostly presence when you use the Ability specific to it.
  

Starting Abilities: 
  ~Echoes~:                   # 1.5 Mana
    A: Passive
    HasMixins: true
    Effect: |
      After you cast a Basic Ability, roll 1d8.
      If you rolled 8 on it, the Ability _echoes_ and you cast it again (for 0 Actions), but ^all^ Damage or Healing it does is reduced by 50%.
      The _echoed_ Ability can't affect the same target(s) or area.
    Notes: |
      Abilities like Recuperate can't _echo_, since the only possible target is yourself.
      If the area overlaps the initial area, the overlapped part has no effect. If it hits the same target(s), it has no effect on them.
      Take the Ability text as it is - _echoing_ Lightning Storm repeats the initial Damage, but you'd have to spend another 1 Action to retrigger the second Lightning Storm.
      The QM has the word on whether something is possible.

          You can not gain extra Defense except through magical means (magic items, spells, etc).
        Notes: |
          Increasing Health Regen increases your Max Health instead (and losing Health Regen loses you Max Health instead).

          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            A spirit animal assists you and gives you a boon, depending on its type.
            You can change which spirit animal assists you while not in Combat.
          Upgrade: The spirit animal is intangible, invulnerable and invisible to most people. You can use it to scout, but can't walk through solid surfaces. You can see through its eyes, but is bound to you and won't go more than 15 meters away from you. It does not participate in combat.
          Notes: An Act counts as ranged if it's not made with a melee weapon, and the range is at least 3 meters
          DoubleTable:

          Cooldown: Once / Adventure
          HasMixins: true
          Effect: |
            All units in a line must succeed a Might Check against _10% of your Max Health_ or be Triple-Stunned. If they succeed, they become Fumbling instead.
            The line is 3 meters wide, and has a length of 1 meter for ever 5 Health you are missing.
          Notes: |
            E.g. if you have 30 out of 50 Health (thus missing 20 Health), then the line will be 4 meters long.
            Cover is applied normally.
          
        <Ruining Shout>:

          A: Passive

        <Jotunn>:
          _Value: 3
          A: 0 Actions
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure
          Duration: 1 Minute
          Effect: |
            You grow to the size of a giant and become Large.
            You gain Shielding equal to 50% of your missing Health.
            Your normal Melee attacks hit all Units within 1 meter of the target for the same Damage, without the Stat modifier (e.g. you don't add your Might or Dexterity to the secondary targets).
            You are immune to being Crowd Control and Hard Terrain.

        <Echoes of Fury>:
          _Value: 3.5
          A: Passive
          HasMixins: true
          Effect: |
            Your _echoes_ can hit the same target (with -50% Damage/Healing). However, if it hits a different target, the Damage or Healing is no longer reduced by 50%.

        <Forced Echoes>:
          _Value: 3
          A: Passive
          HasMixins: true
          Effect: Your Shaman Abilities and Talents ALWAYS _echo_.
          Notes: |
            When Bloodlust _echoes_, the baseline attack (with the Bloodlust Damage included) echoes as well.
            When Ruining Shout _echoes_, it can hit all the same targets.

      Level 9:

        <Echoing Self>:
          _Value: 1.5
          A: Half-Action
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure
          Effect: |
            A spectral self appears at the position where you started your turn, and repeats all Acts you have already done this turn.
          Notes: |
            An Act is considered any Movement, attack or Ability that took at least 0 Actions (does not include Passives that triggered and _echoes_ that had already happened this turn).
            The clone moves exactly as you did (can go through Units) and repeats the Spells and Attacks on the same targets. If there were any dice rolls, the clone rolls them (don't use the same numbers rolled). The clone is a separate special Unit - self effects apply to the clone (and thus self-heals have no effect).

        Replacement: Replaces Mind Link
        HasMixins: true
        Effect: |
          Establish a mind connection with an Ally you can see.
          For the rest of the Adventure, you can talk to eachother telepathically, ~and whenever either of you makes a Check, add the higher bonus from either of you instead of their normal Check bonus~.
        Notes: This does apply to non-combat Skills - if your bonded ally has a non-combat Skill, you also add the ally's Level, as it would normally make sense.

      ~Infinite Echo~:
        _Value: 1
        A: Passive
        HasMixins: true
        Replacement: Replaces Echoes
        Effect: |
          After you cast a Basic Ability, roll ~1d6~.
          If you rolled 6 on it, the Ability echoes and you cast it again (for 0 Actions), but all Damage or Healing it does is reduced by 50%.
          The echoed Ability can't affect the same target(s) or area.
          ~After you echo an Ability, roll the 1d6 echo die again. If you roll 8, repeat!~
        Upgrade: ~Your Basic Abilities can _echo_ again and again. The Damage and Healing remains 50% of its normal amount (e.g. it's not 50% of 50%).~
        Notes: |
          Abilities like Recuperate can't echo, since the only possible target is yourself.
          If the area overlaps the initial area, the overlapped part has no effect. If it hits the same target(s), it has no effect on them.
          Take the Ability text as it is - echoing Lightning Storm repeats the initial Damage, but you'd have to spend another 1 Action to retrigger the second Lightning Storm.

            You become a bodyless soul for up to 8 hours and enter a willing ally.
            While inside the ally's body, you can communicate with them mentally, and only they can see you.
            You can slightly peek outside of their body, and move your arms, upper body and head as if you were a ghost originating from that ally's body.
            {Diamond} You can't move yourself, but you always move with that ally.
            {Diamond} You can't do any physical actions (because you are a ghost and can't touch anything or anyone).
            {Diamond} You can cast spells normally. 
            {Diamond} You follow your own Initiative in combat.
            {Diamond} You can't take Damage or Crowd Control from external sources, but you feel every body sensation that ally feels.
            You can freely exit their body and revert back to your physical self using 0 Actions.

        <Dream Walk>:
          _Value: 1.5
          A: Half-Action

          Effect: |
            Make a Sense Check against another non-Epic Unit's Sense Check. If you succeed, it falls Asleep for 2 turns.
            Alternatively, you can use Dream Walk on an already sleeping target to alter their dreams to your liking.
          Notes: A Sleeping Unit wakes up if it takes Damage or other Crowd Control.

          Effect: |
            You undergo an isolated, personal and mind-altering ritual with a willing non-Warlock Player Character at a campfire, and using incense, smoke and special herbs.
            The ally must make a Sense Check against 6 + Your Sense.
            If it succeeds, its Max Mana permanently increases by 1, and gets +2 to all Checks for the rest of the Adventure.
            If it fails, it takes 1d8 Psychic Damage and gets -1 to all Checks for the rest of the Adventure.
          Upgrade: |
            You can perform this ritual as many times as you want per Adventure until you succeed once. It costs you 1 Mana (not Max Mana), which is spent when the ally passes the ritual.
            A person can only succeed one Enlightening Ritual in their lifetime.
            Respeccing keeps the effects for your Ally.

            Choose one option from Storm, Wind, Heat, Cold.

          Effect: |
            Place a tether on 2 Units within 10 meters of you.
            The next time one of them is Damaged or Healed, the other one takes the Damage (as Psychic Damage) or Healing as well.
          Notes: |
            If both are Damaged/Healed at the same time, this only applies once and you choose which takes the Damage/Healing of the other.
            The extra Damage of Smites, Ambush, etc over an attack counts as the same Damage source.

            Lasts until the ally Rises (or the animal dies too).

          After you cast a Spell, you can expend 5 Health to force it to _echo_.
          You can expend 3 Health to add or subtract 1d6 from any other Unit's roll (not yours).
        Notes: |
          The QM might not roll Damage for monsters, and instead take the average - even if they take the average, that counts as a roll.
          Keep in mind you only have 1 Reaction per Round.

      Level 3:
        
        <Voodoo Magic> :
          _Value: 1.25
          A: 1 Action
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure
          Range: 6 meters
          Effect: |
            A Unit within 6 meters makes a Sense Check.
            If it fails, it takes 2d6 Psychic Damage at the start of your every turn for 1 minute, and for its next turn, you can choose that enemy's Acts as long as it would seem reasonable to that enemy (decide with your QM).
            Epic Monsters can not be controlled; they only take the Damage.
          Notes: For example, you can make a goblin run or recklessly attack one of your party members. But you can't make a guard jump off a cliff, because that's not what it would normally do.

        <Corpseblast>:
          _Value: 1.25
          A: Reaction
          Cost: 2 Health

            Explode the corpse, dealing 1d4 Poison Damage to all Units near it.
            Heal for the Damage dealt.

        <Blood Brew>:
          _Value: 1.25
          A: 10 minutes
          Cost: 4 Health
          Effect: |
            You spend 10 minutes creating a strange splashable brew made from your own blood, with a random effect.
            The brew can be splashed (Half-Action) onto a Unit (at 3 meters range).
            When you create it, roll 1d4 to determine its effect.
            You are immune to Blood Brews.
          Notes: The brews lose their effect at the end of the Adventure. Acid and Muck ignore real Cover.

              - 4. Gas
              - Deals 1d12 Damage in a 5x5 area centered on the target, and a Toxic Gas cloud forms there.

          Range: 6 meters to edge
          Effect: |
            Declare a square area with a diameter equal to the Health spent.
            Sharp bones grow from the area (occupying 1x1 meters each).
            When a Unit steps on a Sharp Bone, it directly takes 1d8 Pierce Damage and loses 1 meter of its remaining speed.
            The bone then shatters.

          Upgrade: You can only use this on targets that have blood.
          Notes: Applies to added extra Damage if it's the same type as the base Damage (e.g. Advanced Flank works, but not Smites).
