Starting Abilities:

  ~Magic Mastery~:    # 1.35
    A: 0 Actions
    Cooldown: Once / Adventure
    Effect: |
      The next ability you use that has the cost of 1 Action now costs a Half-Action.
    Notes: This is not considered a Spell.

  ~Learn Scrolls~:
    A: 10 minutes
    Cooldown: Once / Adventure
    Effect: |
      If you have a Scroll that contains a Basic Ability (e.g. from Arcane, Nature, etc), you can destroy it to Know it permanently, without needing to learn it inbetween Adventures.
    Notes: You can not learn Class Abilities from Scrolls. Of course, you still need to spend Mana and respect the Cooldown of said Ability.

Starting Abilities Description:
  - Magic Mastery: |
      Magic Mastery can convert a Spell from a Half-Action to 1 Action.
      You can use this twice per turn or multiple times per turn to dish out a lot of spells in quick succession, in a single turn.
      It is not considered a Spell because some other Mage abilities affect Spells specifically, so Magic Mastery is unaffacted by them.

Specializations:
  Description: At Level 1, you can choose your specialization. Every Mage can choose from the following Mage specializations
  Choices:
    - Sorcerer, a born user of magic, floating with the hard to control magic itself
    - Wizard, who became a master of magic through intense study, and carries its spells in an indispensible tome
    - Artificer, who is dedicated to creation, research and experimentation with magical potions, scrolls and magical items!

        A: Passive
        Cooldown: Once / Adventure
        Effect: |
            You have a special Spell Book.
            Once per Adventure, you can cast a Spell you know that costs Mana without spending Mana.
        Notes: You must still spend the required Actions.
      
      ~Magic Expertise~:  # Might be game breaking lmao
        A: Passive
        Effect: For you, all Basic Spells have their Level requirement lowered by 4.
        Notes: E.g. You can learn Reverse Gravity from Level 2 (which would normally require Level 6).

    Talents:
      Level 3:

        <Counterspell>:  # 1 Charge
          A: Reaction
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure
          Effect: When a Unit you can see casts a Spell, cancel it. It loses the Action (but not the Mana or Cooldown).

        <Conjuration Specialization>:   # 1 Charge
          A: Passive
          Effect: Whenever you spend any amount of Mana on a Conjuration Spell, give a Unit you can see Shielding equal to your current Mana (after the cast).
        
        <Arcane Specialization>:    # 1 Charge
          A: Passive
          Effect: Whenever you spend any amount of Mana on an Arcane Spell, shoot a magic missile at a target within 10 meters that instantly deals 1d4 Force Damage.

        <Eldritch Specialization>:  # 0.5 Charges
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            You gain access to the Eldritch Basic Ability List, and when you cast an Eldritch Spell, you can choose to split the d8's into 2d4's and d12's into 2d6's.
          Notes: |
            For example, if a Spell deals 2d8 Damage, that becomes 4d4.
            It might sound like the same thing, but because of math, 4d4 is actually, on average, 1 extra Damage compared to 2d8.

        <Force Pulse>:  # 1 Charge
          A: 0 Actions
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure

                This can only happen if you're wearing Medium Armor (or Heavy) or a Shield.

            {Diamond} For every 2 dice in its Damage, roll 1 more
            {Diamond} If it targets an area, freely change the area to a 4x4 meter zone, 8x1 meter line or 5 meter 90* cone

        A: Passive
        Effect: |
          After you enter combat, when you would cast the same Spell the 3rd time in a row, it takes a Half-Action less to cast (e.g. from 1 Action to Half-Action, from Half-Action to 0 Actions; minimum 0 Actions).
          Then you can't use that Spell again for the rest of the Adventure.
        Upgrade: Casting any other Spell inbetween those casts interrupts the sequence, but you can do non-Spell Acts in-between, like weapon attacks, moving and using items.
        Notes: E.g. after casting Flame Bolt on turn 1, Flame Bolt on turn 2, if your next Spell is Flamebolt, it only takes a Half-Action to cast.

          Notes: |
            For example, if a Spell deals 2d8 Damage, that becomes 4d4.
            it might sound like the same thing, but because of math, 4d4 is actually, on average, 1 extra Damage compared to 2d8.

        <Wild Cast>:                # 1.5, but it's random af, so the extra power is justified
          A: Half-Action
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure
          Effect: |
            Roll 1d6 and 1d8. This spell has the effect of the 2 combined rolls.
            For the 1d6:
            1. Attack a target for 4d6 Fire Damage
            2. A target must pass a Dexterity Check or take 3d8 Cold Damage (or half if it passes).
            3. Target all Units in a 4x4 area. Attack them all for 2d8 + 2 Shock Damage.
            4. Two Units instantly take 8 Force Damage.
            5. Attack all units in a 6x1 line from your position for 6d4 Pierce Damage.
            6. One Unit you choose takes 1d12 Force Damage and is pushed 6 meters in any direction you choose.
            For the 1d8:
            1. Nothing else happens.
            2. Target(s) all take an extra 2d6 Damage of the Damage type of the 1d6 effect.

            Effect: |
                Shoot a comet that changes in power the longer it travels - it deals Damage and Crowd Controls a target.
                It attacks for 1d6 Force Damage for every meter it travels (up to 8d6).
                However, the longer it travels, the weaker it's Crowd Control is.
                Apply the following Crowd Control (directly, without a Check) to the target depending on the distance traveled (distance between you and the target):
                {Diamond} 1 or 2 meters: Stun
                {Diamond} 3 or 4 meters: Fumbling
                {Diamond} 5 or 6 meters: Root
                {Diamond} 7 or 8 meters: None

        <Star Burst>:       # +5.5 extra Damage per Charge spent (but its so random it still might be too weak)

                Declare up to 4 different targets within 15 meters.
                Assign a different number from #1 to #4 to each.
                Roll a number of d4's equal to double your Intelligence or Charisma (whichever is higher). Each number deals that much Shock Damage to the target with that number.
                Each rolled 1 deals 1 Damage to target number #1.
                Each rolled 2 deals 2 Damage to target number #2.
                And so on.
            Notes: |
                E.g. if you put #2 on a goblin, and you roll three 2's on the d4's, then that goblin takes 6 Force Damage.
                You should probably assign the higher number to the target you want to do most Damage to.
                You can declare fewer targets, but then the missing number will deal Damage to no target.
                Cover is applied normally.

    Starting Abilities:

      ~Artificer~:
        A: Special
        Effect: |
          You own a set of Artificer's Tools, with which you can create potions, scrolls and other items.
          Some of your class spells require you to use your Artificer's Tools (described below).
          If they require you to spend Mana, that Mana becomes locked and can't be regained through any means, until the item created is used or destroyed.
          For 1 Action, you can summon or vanish your Artificer's Tools.
          Furthermore, you can use your Artificer's Tools for 10 minutes to make items shed light, emmit a sound or smell or paint surfaces in rough images or writing. The magical effects last for up to 8 hours.
          Feel free to be creative with what you can do - the tools might do other small artificer tasks as well. Ask your DM!
        Notes: |
          Spells noted as 'Artificer' require you to use Artificer's Tools.
          If you ever lose your Artificer's Tools, the price for a new set is 100 gold.
          As usual, items created this way require a Half-Action to use.
          Artificer potions do not count towards the potion limit cooldown.
          Artificer's Tools's small tasks are a non-combat. You can't use them to deal Damage, crowd control or heal.

        Notes: |
          Remember that scrolls always take a Half-Action to use and can be used by anyone, including non-spellcasters.
          Mana spent for the spell inside the scroll when creating the scroll does become locked as well.

            {Diamond} +1 Damage if it's a One-Handed Weapon (or +2 if it's Two-Handed)
            {Diamond} Damage can freely be converted to Fire/Cold/Shock (choose one)
            {Diamond} +2 meters move speed while wielding it
            {Diamond} Wielder starts combat with 1d6 Shielding
            You can only have 1 Magic Weapon created at a time.
            The Magic Weapon is automatically destroyed after 24 hours.

        <Spellcraft>: Inherit from Wizard

            

      Level 5:
        
        <Artificer - Golem>:            # 2, but it costs 1 Charge so #1 first time, then #0; However, golems can be quite strong, so I hope it evens out
            A: 1 Action
            Cost: Depends
            Range: 3 meters to edge
            Effect: |
              Choose an empty 2x2 meter space and deploy a Golem there that lasts until the end of your next Adventure.
              Choose if it's made of Clay, Metal or Flesh. It has different Abilities based on its material. You can find the Golem's stats in the Pets section.
              The first time you summon a Golem this Adventure, it costs 1 Mana. Then, every Golem you summon costs 1 Mana more than the previous.
            Notes: The Golem has 0 initiative, so it usually takes its turn last in combat.
              
        <Artificer - Autoturret>:       # 1.5 but you can summon a ton of them
            A: 0 Actions
            Cost: 1 Mana
            Range: 6 meters
            Cooldown: 2 times / Turn
            Effect: |
                Choose an element: Fire, Cold, Shock or Force.
                Choose an empty space to deploy an Autoturret of that element.
                On your turn, each Autoturret can attack for 1d6 Pierce Damage that ignores Defense and all resistances.
                It has 10 Health and fails all Checks.
            Notes: Cover from the turrets is applied normally. The turret can't move unless picked up and dropped elsewhere.

        <Artificer - Grenade>:          # 2, but it costs 1 Mana so it sounds fair.
            HasMixins: true
            A: Half-Action
            Cost: 1 Mana
            Range: 6 meters to edge
            Cooldown: 1 use / Encounter
            Effect: |
                Throw a grenade at a target 5x5x5 meter area.
                Choose one of the following effects. It applies to all Units caught in the area.
                {Diamond} Units must pass a Might Check or be Stunned and take 1d8 Fire Damage.
                {Diamond} Units must pass a Dexterity Check or take 3d8 Smash, Pierce or Slash Damage (you choose) and be knocked away from the center of the area to closest space outside of the edge of the area. If a unit passes, it only takes half of that Damage.
                {Diamond} The grenade explodes at the start of your next turn and deals Fire Damage equal to 4d6 + your Intelligence or Charisma (whichever is higher).
            Notes: Alternatively, you create the Grenade out of combat and give it to an ally to use. If you do this, only one Grenade can be thrown during a combat. A second grenade has no effect (since it's magical by nature and draws from your magic power). This is considered an attack.

      Level 7:
                
        <Artificer - Magic Armor>:
            HasMixins: true
            A: 5 minutes
            Cooldown: Once / Adventure
            Effect: |
                You magically enchant a piece of armor for the rest of the Adventure.
                Apply all of the following effects to it:
                {Diamond} +1 Defense
                {Diamond} Choose a Damage type. Wearer takes only 50% Damage from that type.
                {Diamond} +2 meters Movement Speed, and the wearer can freely jump up to 2 meters (up or ahead; this still uses Movement).
