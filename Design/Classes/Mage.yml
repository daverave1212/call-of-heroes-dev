    A: 0 Actions
    Cost: 1 Mana

Starting Abilities Description:
  - Magic Mastery: |
      Magic Mastery can convert a Spell from a Half-Action to 1 Action.
      You can use this twice per turn or multiple times per turn to dish out a lot of spells in quick succession, in a single turn.
      It is not considered a Spell because some other Mage abilities affect Spells specifically, so Magic Mastery is unaffacted by them.

  Choices:
    - Sorcerer, a born user of magic, floating with the hard to control magic itself

      Level 3:

          A: Reaction
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure
          Effect: When a Unit you can see casts a Spell, cancel it. It loses the Action (but not the Mana or Cooldown).

          A: Passive

            You gain access to the Eldritch Basic Ability List, and when you cast an Eldritch Spell, you can choose to split the d8's into 2d4's and d12's into 2d6's.
          Notes: |
            For example, if a Spell deals 2d8 Damage, that becomes 4d4.
            It might sound like the same thing, but because of math, 4d4 is actually, on average, 1 extra Damage compared to 2d8.

          A: 0 Actions
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure

        A: Passive
        Effect: |
          After you enter combat, when you would cast the same Spell the 3rd time in a row, it takes a Half-Action less to cast (e.g. from 1 Action to Half-Action, from Half-Action to 0 Actions; minimum 0 Actions).
          Then you can't use that Spell again for the rest of the Adventure.
        Upgrade: Casting any other Spell inbetween those casts interrupts the sequence, but you can do non-Spell acts in-between, like weapon attacks, moving and using items.
        Notes: E.g. after casting Flame Bolt on turn 1, Flame Bolt on turn 2, if your next Spell is Flamebolt, it only takes a Half-Action to cast.

            You gain access to the Eldritch Basic Ability List, and when you cast an Eldritch Spell, you can choose to split the d8's into 2d4's and d12's into 2d6's.
          Notes: |
            For example, if a Spell deals 2d8 Damage, that becomes 4d4.
            it might sound like the same thing, but because of math, 4d4 is actually, on average, 1 extra Damage compared to 2d8.
  
        <Wild Cast>:                # 1.5, but it's random af, so the extra power is justified
          A: Half-Action
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure
          Effect: |
            Roll 1d6 and 1d8. This spell has the effect of the 2 combined rolls.
            For the 1d6:
            1. Attack a target for 3d6 Fire Damage
            2. A target must pass a Dexterity Check or take 2d8 Cold Damage (or half if it passes).
            3. Target all Units in a 4x4 area. Attack them all for 2d6 + 2 Shock Damage.
            4. Two Units instantly take 6 Force Damage.
            5. Attack all units in a 6x1 line from your position for 4d4 Pierce Damage.
            6. One Unit you choose takes 1d10 Force Damage and is pushed 3 meters away from you.
            For the 1d8:
            1. Nothing else happens.
            2. Target(s) all take an extra 2d6 Damage (directly, ignoring Defense) of the Damage type of the 1d6 effect.
            3. Target(s) must pass an Dexterity Check or be Rooted.
            4. Target(s) must pass an Dexterity Check or be Crippled.
            5. Target(s) must pass an Intelligence Check or be Silenced.
            6. Target(s) must pass a Sense Check or be Feared.

            Range: 8 meters
            Effect: |
                Shoot a comet that changes in power the longer it travels - it deals Damage and Crowd Controls a target.
                It attacks for 1d4 Force Damage for every meter it travels (up to 8d4) (all against Defense).
                However, the longer it travels, the weaker it's Crowd Control is.
                Apply the following Crowd Control (directly, without a Check) to the target depending on the distance traveled (distance between you and the target):
                {Diamond} 1 or 2 meters: Stun
                {Diamond} 3 or 4 meters: Fumbling
                {Diamond} 5 or 6 meters: Root
                {Diamond} 7 or 8 meters: None

        <Star Burst>:       # +5.5 extra Damage per Charge spent (but its so random it still might be too weak)
            AlignOnWebsite: Right
            A: Half-Action
            Cost: 1 Mana
            Effect: |
                Declare up to 4 different targets within 15 meters.
                Assign a different number from #1 to #4 to each.
                Roll (3 + Main Stat) d4's. Each number deals that much Shock Damage to the target with that number.
                Each rolled 1 deals 1 Damage to target number #1.
                Each rolled 2 deals 2 Damage to target number #2.
                And so on.
            Notes: |
                E.g. if you put #2 on a goblin, and you roll three 2's on the d4's, then that goblin takes 6 Force Damage.
                You should probably assign the higher number to the target you want to do most Damage to.
                You can declare fewer targets, but then the missing number will deal Damage to no target.
                Cover is applied normally.

            Effect: Your single-target Spells that deal half Damage when a target passes a Check now deal the full Damage regardless.

    Starting Abilities:

      ~Artificer~:
        A: Special
        Effect: |
          You own a set of Artificer's Tools, with which you can create potions, scrolls and other items.
          Some of your class spells require you to use your Artificer's Tools (described below).
          If they require you to spend Mana, that Mana becomes locked and can't be regained through any means, until the item created is used or destroyed.
          For 1 Action, you can summon or vanish your Artificer's Tools.
          Furthermore, you can use your Artificer's Tools for 10 minutes to make items shed light, emmit a sound or smell or paint surfaces in rough images or writing. The magical effects last for up to 8 hours.
          Feel free to be creative with what you can do - the tools might do other small artificer tasks as well. Ask your DM!
        Notes: |
          Spells noted as 'Artificer' require you to use Artificer's Tools.
          If you ever lose your Artificer's Tools, the price for a new set is 200 gold.
          As usual, items created this way require a Half-Action to use.
          Artificer potions do not count towards the potion limit cooldown.
          Artificer's Tools's small tasks are a non-combat. You can't use them to deal Damage, crowd control or heal.

          Choose a Spell you can cast and spend Mana for it if it requires Mana.
          You create a scroll containing that spell.
        Notes: |
          Remember that scrolls always take a Half-Action to use and can be used by anyone, including non-spellcasters.
          Mana spent for the spell inside the scroll when creating the scroll does become locked as well.

            A: 1 Action
            Cost: Depends
            Range: 3 meters to edge
            Effect: |
              Choose an empty 2x2 meter space and deploy a Golem there that lasts until the end of your next Adventure.
              Choose if it's made of Clay, Metal or Flesh. It has different Abilities based on its material. You can find the Golem's stats in the Pets section.
              The first time you summon a Golem this Adventure, it costs 1 Mana. Then, every Golem you summon costs 1 Mana more than the previous.
            Notes: The Golem has 0 initiative, so it usually takes its turn last in combat.
              
        <Artificer - Autoturret>:       # 1.5 but you can summon a ton of them
            A: 0 Actions
            Cost: 1 Mana
            Range: 6 meters
            Cooldown: 2 times / Turn
            Effect: |
                Choose an element: Fire, Cold, Shock or Force.
                Choose an empty space to deploy an Autoturret of that element.
                On your turn, you can freely make one attack with each Autoturret for 1d4 direct Damage that ignores Defense and all resistances.
                It has 5 Health, 7 Defense and fails all Checks.
            Notes: Cover from the turrets is applied normally.

        <Artificer - Grenade>:          # 2, but it costs 1 Mana so it sounds fair.
            HasMixins: true
            A: Half-Action
            Cost: 1 Mana
            Range: 6 meters to edge
            Cooldown: 1 use / Encounter
            Effect: |
                Throw a grenade at a target 5x5x5 meter area.
                Choose one of the following effects. It applies to all Units caught in the area.
                {Diamond} Units must pass a Might Check or be Stunned
                {Diamond} Units must pass a Dexterity Check or take 6d4 Smash, Pierce or Slash Damage (you choose) and be knocked away from the center of the area to closest space outside of the edge of the area. If a unit passes, it only takes half of that Damage.
                {Diamond} The grenade explodes at the start of your next turn and deals 4d8 + Main Stat Fire Damage (against Defense).
            Notes: Alternatively, you create the Grenade out of combat and give it to an ally to use. If you do this, only one Grenade can be thrown during a combat. A second grenade has no effect (since it's magical by nature and draws from your magic power). This is considered an attack.

      Level 7:
                
        <Artificer - Magic Armor>:
            HasMixins: true
            A: 5 minutes
            Cooldown: Once / Adventure
            Effect: |
                You magically enchant a piece of armor for the rest of the Adventure.
                Apply all of the following effects to it:
                {Diamond} +1 Defense
                {Diamond} Choose a Damage type. Wearer takes only 50% Damage from that type.
                {Diamond} +2 meters Movement Speed, and the wearer can freely jump up to 2 meters (up or ahead; this still uses Movement).
