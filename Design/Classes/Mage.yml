    You don't have restrictions for how many times you can cast a spell per Long Rest, but you have restrictions on your Charges.
    Advanced Abilities are all Abilities from the Spell Lists listed as Advanced.
    If an Ability is not listed as Advanced, you can use it as many times as you like.

  Spell DC: 6 + (Main Stat)
  Charges:
    Amount: 3
    Regain: You regain all Charges back when you Long Rest.
  Change: You can change your known Spells (not Talents) when taking a Long Rest.
