Starting Abilities Description:
  - Magic Mastery: |
      Magic Mastery can convert a Spell from a Half-Action to 1 Action.
      You can use this twice per turn or multiple times per turn to dish out a lot of spells in quick succession, in a single turn.
      It is not considered a Spell because some other Mage abilities affect Spells specifically, so Magic Mastery is unaffacted by them.

Specializations:
  Description: At Level 1, you can choose your specialization. Every Mage can choose from the following Mage specializations
  Choices:
    - Sorcerer, a born user of magic, floating with the hard to control magic itself
    - Wizard, who became a master of magic through intense study, and carries its spells in an indispensible tome
    - Artificer, who is dedicated to creation, research and experimentation with magical potions, scrolls and magical items!

        Effect: You have 1 extra Max Mana.
      
      ~Magic Expertise~:  # Might be game breaking lmao
        A: Passive
        Effect: For you, all Basic Spells have their Level requirement lowered by 3.
        Notes: E.g. You can learn Reverse Gravity from Level 3 (which would normally require Level 6).

    Talents:
      Level 3:

        # <Counterspell>:  # 1 Charge
        #   A: Reaction
        #   Cooldown: Once / Adventure
        #   Effect: When a Unit you can see casts a Spell, cancel it. It loses the Action (but not the Mana or Cooldown).

        <Pyromancy>:
          _Value: 1.5
          A: Passive
          Effect: The first time hit 2 or more Worthy Enemies with a Spell every turn, increase all Fire Damage you deal by 1 for the rest of the combat.

        <Conjurism>:
          _Value: 1.5
          A: Passive
          Duration: 1 minute
          Effect: Whenever you spend any amount of Mana on a Conjuration Spell, give a Unit you can see Shielding equal to your current Mana (after the cast).
        
        <Arcanism>:
          _Value: 2
          A: Passive
          Effect: Whenever you spend any amount of Mana on an Arcane Spell, shoot a magic missile at a target within 10 meters that instantly deals 1d4 Force Damage and ignores Defense and Cover.

        <Eldritchianism>:
          _Value: 1
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            You gain access to the Eldritch Basic Ability List, and when you cast a Spell, you can choose to split the d8's into 2d4's and d12's into 2d6's.
            Also, add your Intelligence to your Initiative.
          Notes: |
            For example, if a Spell deals 2d8 Damage, that becomes 4d4.
            It might sound like the same thing, but because of math, 4d4 is actually, on average, 1 extra Damage compared to 2d8.

        <Hydromancy>:
          _Value: 1.5
          A: Passive
          Effect: Whenever you apply Crowd Control other than Slows to a Unit in a Worthy Combat, increase all Cold Damage you deal by 2 for the rest of the combat.
          Notes: Hard Terrain does not count as Crowd Control.

        #   Cooldown: Once / Adventure
        #   Effect: All enemies within 10 meters must succeed a Might Check or be Fumbling and take 1d4 Force Damage.

          _Value: 2
          A: Reaction
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure
          Effect: |
            Use when an ally (or you) would be hit by a missile (before hitting the target).
            Fling it from air back to the attacker (with the exact Damage and effects).
        
        <Animation>:
          _Value: 2.5
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            Whenever you spend Mana on a Spell that doesn't deal Damage, you can pick a Large or Medium object within 6 meters and bring it to life.
            It has 3 Speed, can fly and can attack for 1d4 Smash, Slash or Pierce Damage.
            Lasts 1 minute or until it takes Damage (after which it returns to its inanimate form).
          Notes: Alternatively, it can use Dash, Push or Taunt once.

          _Value: 2
          A: Passive
          Duration: 1 minute
          Effect: |
            After you use Magic Mastery, choose an ally.
            Create a clone of them on a space within 2 meters of them, and teleport the ally 2 meters in any direction (as to create a diversion).
            The clone has the same Health and other stats, but takes 300% of the Damage it takes.
            The clone can pretend to do anything the ally can do. If it attacks with a weapon or Spell, it can do at most 1 Psychic Damage per attack Act.
          Upgrade: An enemy can't tell which Unit is real and which is the clone until the clone does something relevant and the Unit has at least 3 Intelligence.
          Notes: |
            E.g. the clone could cast Magic Missiles, but only one missile will deal 1 Damage (you can choose which, and apply Cover, Defense and other penalties normally - e.g. 1 Damage with Cover becomes 0 Damage). Alternatively, for example, it could attack twice with a one-handed weapon for 1 Damage each.

            {Diamond} For every 2 dice in its Damage, roll 1 more

            {Diamond} Change it's Check Stat to any other Stat (if it requires a Check)
            {Diamond} Swap Root, Cripple or Silence
            {Diamond} Swap Slow, Fumbling, Rooted or Pushing with any other of these (Push a target 2 meters away from you or from the area center)
            {Diamond} Double its range
            At any point, you can expend 1 Mana to reset the Cooldown of this Spell (Spellcraft).

      Level 7:

        <Grand Wizardry>:
          _Value: 2.5
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            Magic Mastery becomes usable 2 more times per Adventure.
            Basic Spells that cost Mana and have a Cooldown have no Cooldown for you.

          Effect: |

          Notes: This is optional.

        <Evocation>:
          _Value: 3
          A: Half-Action
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure

          HasMixins: true
          Effect: |
            Take the form of an _evoker_ - a being made of pure energy.
            While in the _evoker_ form, all Damage you deal from all sources becomes Force Damage, and all your spells that cost 2 or more Mana now cost 1 less.
            You can breathe underwater and fly at normal Speed.
          Notes: You can't end your turn inside an obstacle, and you can't move through walls, ceilings and floors.

      Level 9:

        <Chronomancy>:  # ~3 or more
          A: 0 Actions
          Cost: 1 Mana
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure
          Effect: |
            Instantly return to how and where you were at the start of the turn, with that same Movement, Actions, Health, Shielding, Buffs and Cooldowns (not Mana, though).
            Alternatively, if you're out of combat, you can turn back time for all the world up to 10 minutes, exactly how it was, but retaining all your information from the future. Allies don't retain the information.

        <Graviturgy>:
          A: Half-Action
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure
          Duration: Until the start of your next turn
          Effect: |
            Choose a 5x5x5 meter cube.
            That area become frozen in time - Units skip their turns and can't be damaged or affected by anything.
            Any object that touches the area becomes frozen, too (and, if it is a missile, resumes its trajectory when the area ends).

        A: Passive
        Effect: |
          At the start of your every turn in a Worthy Combat, roll 1d10.
          If you roll 10, your first Spell this turn becomes affected by Magic Mastery if possible, regardless of its Cooldown.

          Effect: |
            When you roll the Unstable Spark d10, if you roll 1 or 2, roll another 1d20 and a random Spell is automatically cast from the table below on a target/Unit "randomly" chosen by the GM.
            If you roll 1, the effect will be negative for your team, if possible. If you roll 2, the effect is positive, if possible.
          Notes: |
            For example, if you roll 1 and the random Spell is Fire Enchantment, it will be cast on an enemy's weapon if possible (respecting the range). If not possible, then it will be cast on a random, non-Player Character's weapon. If not possible, then it will be cast on a Player Character's weapon. If nothing is possible, nothing happens.
            If an effect can be cancelled or has ongoing effects, you have control of them as if you yourself had cast the Spell.

            Range: 8 meters
            Effect: |
                Shoot a comet that changes in power the longer it travels - it deals Damage and Crowd Controls a target.
                It attacks for 1d6 Force Damage for every meter it travels (up to 8d6).
                However, the longer it travels, the weaker it's Crowd Control is.
                Apply the following Crowd Control (directly, without a Check) to the target depending on the distance traveled (distance between you and the target):
                {Diamond} 1 or 2 meters: Stun
                {Diamond} 3 or 4 meters: Fumbling
                {Diamond} 5 or 6 meters: Root
                {Diamond} 7 or 8 meters: None

                Declare up to 4 different targets within 15 meters.
                Assign a different number from #1 to #4 to each.
                Roll a number of d4's equal to double your Intelligence or Charisma (whichever is higher). Each number deals that much Force Damage to the target with that number.
                Each rolled 1 deals 1 Damage to target number #1.
                Each rolled 2 deals 2 Damage to target number #2.
                And so on.
            Notes: |
                E.g. if you put #2 on a goblin, and you roll three 2's on the d4's, then that goblin takes 6 Force Damage.
                You should probably assign the higher number to the target you want to do most Damage to.
                You can declare fewer targets, but then the missing number will deal Damage to no target.
                Cover is applied normally.

            Alternatively, if you're out of combat, you can turn back time for all the world up to 10 minutes, exactly how it was, but retaining all your information from the future. Allies don't retain the information.

            If both are 10, your first 2 Spells this turn become affected by Magic Mastery instead.

            Notes: Alternatively, you create the Grenade and give it to an ally to use. If you do this, only one Grenade can be thrown during a combat. A second grenade has no effect (since it's magical by nature and draws from your magic power).
