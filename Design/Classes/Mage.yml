    - Book is alive!!


Class: Mage
Description: |
  You step inside the magic circle, and an incantation of fire, frost, and lightning begins. The figure with robes and glowing eyes moves around, raw energy emanating from their palms. A book lays open on the floor, pages flipping themselves and shifting through bright violet runes. The circle is abruptly broken, and the magic stops, as you notice the mage caressing his beard, eyes all on you. Did the spell fail? Could this be a mistake? An error in the code of arcane? Mages work in mysterious ways...
  Mages are channelers magic, refiners of the coarse arcane, directly from the source, who can transform those vibrations into elemental energies. Mastery over magics has made their spells fast and efficient, but in their choice of spells and invocations, no two mages are alike.
  Wizards are in a continuous study of magic, and their mind is trained for accessing higher-order spells ahead of time, while sorcerers prefer a more random (albeit practical) usage of magic, going with the flow. Artificers are the complete opposite, however, prefering rigurious crafts of trial and error until they excel in their preferred creation field - alchemy, tinkering, even blacksmithing.

Starting Abilities Description:
  - Magic Mastery: |
      Magic Mastery can convert a Spell from a Half-Action to 1 Action.
      You can use this twice per turn or multiple times per turn to dish out a lot of spells in quick succession, in a single turn.
      It is not considered a Spell because some other Mage abilities affect Spells specifically, so Magic Mastery is unaffacted by them.

Specializations:
  Description: At Level 1, you can choose your specialization. Every Mage can choose from the following Mage specializations
  Choices:
    - Sorcerer, a born user of magic, floating with the hard to control magic itself
    - Wizard, who became a master of magic through intense study, and carries its spells in an indispensible tome
    - Artificer, who is dedicated to creation, research and experimentation with magical potions, scrolls and magical items!

            Lasts 1 minute or until it takes Damage (after which it returns to its inanimate form).
          Notes: Alternatively, it can use Sprint, Push or Taunt once.

        <Illusionism>:
          _Value: 2
          A: Passive
          Duration: 1 minute
          Effect: |
            After you use Magic Mastery, choose an ally.
            Create a clone of them on a space within 2 meters of them, and teleport the ally 2 meters in any direction (as to create a diversion).
            The clone has the same Health and other stats, but takes 300% of the Damage it takes.
            The clone can pretend to do anything the ally can do. If it attacks with a weapon or Spell, it can do at most 1 Psychic Damage per attack Act.
          Upgrade: An enemy can't tell which Unit is real and which is the clone until the clone does something relevant and the Unit has at least 3 Intelligence.
          Notes: |
            E.g. the clone could cast Magic Missiles, but only one missile will deal 1 Damage (you can choose which, and apply Cover, Defense and other penalties normally - e.g. 1 Damage with Cover becomes 0 Damage). Alternatively, for example, it could attack twice with a one-handed weapon for 1 Damage each.

            {Diamond} For every 2 dice in its Damage, roll 1 more
            {Diamond} If it targets an area, increase it or decrease it by 50%
            {Diamond} Change its Damage type to any type, except Divine and True Damage
            {Diamond} If it specifies a Stat, change it to any other Stat
            {Diamond} Swap any of Root, Cripple or Silence (with any of the remaining)
            {Diamond} Swap Slow, Fumbling, or Pushing with any other of these (Push a target 2 meters away from you or from the area center)
            {Diamond} Double its range
            At any point, you can expend 1 Mana to reset the Cooldown of this Spell (Spellcraft).

        <Grand Wizardry>:
          _Value: 2.5
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            Spells that cost 3 or more Mana cost 1 less for you.
            Basic Spells that cost Mana and have a Cooldown have no Cooldown for you.
        
        <Destruction>:
          _Value: 4
          A: Passive
          HasMixins: true
          Effect: |
            Whenever you deal Damage with a Spell that cost Mana, zap a Unit within 4 meters for ^your Intelligence^ Shock Damage.
          Notes: This is optional.

        <Evocation>:
          _Value: 3

          HasMixins: true
          Effect: |
            Take the form of an _evoker_ - a being made of pure energy.
            While in the _evoker_ form, all Damage you deal from all sources becomes Pulse Damage, and all your spells that cost 2 or more Mana now cost 1 less.
            You can breathe underwater and fly at normal Speed.
          Notes: You can't end your turn inside an obstacle, and you can't move through walls, ceilings and floors.

          Effect: |
            Instantly return to how and where you were at the start of the turn, with that same Movement, Actions, Health, Shielding, Buffs and Cooldowns (not Mana, though).
            Alternatively, if you're out of combat, you can turn back time for all the world up to 10 minutes, exactly how it was, but retaining all your information from the future. Allies don't retain the information.

        <Graviturgy>:
          A: Half-Action
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure
          Duration: Until the start of your next turn
          Effect: |
            Choose a 5x5x5 meter cube.
            That area become frozen in time - Units skip their turns and can't be damaged or affected by anything.
            Any object that touches the area becomes frozen, too (and, if it is a missile, resumes its trajectory when the area ends).

      Level 10:

        <Hermeticism>:
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            You know all Basic Spells and they all cost 1 less Mana to cast. If they cost 0 Mana, they instead restore 1 Mana if used in Combat.
            You may create your own _homebrew_ Spells as per the rules of _QM Resources, Homebrewing Abilities_.
            You can use Restricted Abilities even if restricted in your current adventures.

        <Highmancy>:
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            Your chosen Level 3 Talent triggers 3 times when it happens. When using Magic Mastery on a Spell with the same element as your Level 3 Talent, it no longer gets its ^Dice Downgraded^.
          Upgrade: All your other Spells become themed to the same element, but keep their original Damage Type. For example, if you chose fire, Frost Nova will now burst in cold, blue flames instead of ice.
          Notes: For example, when you hit multiple Units with an Ability, you increase your Fire Damage by +3 instead of +1, or you gain +6 Cold Damage from Hydromancy when you Crowd Control an Enemy. For Eldritchianism, your Spells have their ^Dice Upgraded^ 3 times.

            When you roll the Unstable Spark die, if you roll 2 or 3, roll another 1d20 and a random Spell is automatically cast from the table below on a target/Unit "randomly" chosen by the QM.
            If you roll 2, the effect will be negative for your team, if possible. If you roll 3, the effect is positive, if possible.
          Notes: |
            For example, if you roll 2 and the random Spell is Fire Enchantment, it will be cast on an enemy's weapon if possible (respecting the range). If not possible, then it will be cast on a random, non-Player Character's weapon. If not possible, then it will be cast on a Player Character's weapon. If nothing is possible, nothing happens.
            If an effect can be cancelled or has ongoing effects, you have control of them as if you yourself had cast the Spell.

            Notes: Mana and Health can't be expended or Damaged in fractions, but if you manage to get this 2 times, you essentially get +1 Health permanently (or 1 Mana permanently if you trigger this 4 times).

                Assign a different number from #1 to #4 to each.
                Roll a number of d4's equal to your last rolled Unstable Spark die. Each d4 rolled deals that much Pulse Damage to the target with that number.
                Each rolled 1 deals 1 Damage to target number #1, each rolled 2 deals 2 Damage to target number #2, and so on.
            Notes: |
                E.g. if you put #2 on a goblin, and you roll three 2's on the d4's, then that goblin takes 6 Pulse Damage.
                You should probably assign the higher number to the target you want to do most Damage to.
                You can declare fewer targets, but then the missing number will deal Damage to no target.
                Cover is applied normally.
