Armor Training: Light Armor

Weapons: You are Trained in 2 Weapon Categories of choice (e.g. 1-Handed Melee, 2-Handed Ranged, Shields, etc).

  You know Thieves' Cant!
  Thieves' Cant is not a spoken language, but rather a set of symbols, sign language and code names for various objects, places or people.
  Use Thieves' Cant wisely!

Proficiency Requirements: You have Proficiency in Stealth and a number of extra Proficiencies equal to your Intelligence.

Proficiencies:
    ~Proficiency in Stealth~: Inherit
    
Proficiencies Description: |
    Rogues are naturally talented when it comes to subtlety. Proficiency in stealth may come in handy particularily if the Game Master ever issues you to roll a Check for remaining stealthed when you use Hide (an Ability you get as a Rogue, see below).

    Rogues can be experienced in many domains, from city dwelling to dungeoneering, so choose well!

  Recommended Basic Abilities:
    - Bloodshed: Shank
    - Bloodshed: Recuperate
    - Bloodshed: Slam
    - Warfare: Lightstrike

  Recommended Abilities Description: |
    Shank is there to help you spend your Mana in uncanny situations where you need just a little more damage to finish of an enemy. In case of an emergency, Recuperate is there to heal you, while Slam will deal area damage in case you're fighting multiple enemies. Finally, if you find out your enemies are resistant to your weapon attacks, get Lightstrike. It's situational, but it can be effective!

 

# Idea: For each Mana spent on Ambush, X happens
# Spec: Ambush procs when attacking a target you haven't attacked this combat
# Talents: Choose another condition for ambush and it gains +1d8 for that condition too

Starting Abilities Description:
  - Ambush: |
      Ambush can normally happen only once per turn, and you can charge it up to deal more Damage!
      However, your Rogue Specialization will give you extra ways to Ambush target!
  - Hide: |
      Essentially, you can interrupt another Unit's turn, put that unit on pause, and start your turn. When your turn ends, the Unit resumes its turn.
      Before you attack an enemy group, you can tell your DM where you are sitting, so that you benefit from cover.
      
Starting Abilities:
  
  ~Ambush~ :
    _Value: 1
    AlignOnWebsite: Right
    A: Passive
    Cooldown: 1 / Turn
    Effect: |
      If you start your turn Hidden, your first weapon attack deals 1d8 extra Damage.
    Notes: |
      Your Specialization will give you extra ways to Ambush.
      
  ~Hide~:       # Ok
    A: Special
    Cooldown: Once per encounter
    Effect: |
      When combat starts, if you have Cover from all enemies, you start as Hidden.
      While Hidden, you can skip your turn.
      Then, you can unhide and start your turn whenever you like (even during enemies' turns)!
    Notes: |
      Starting your turn unhides you.
      Be careful: if you don't start your turn this round, you lose your turn!
      If you want to start during an enemy's turn, you do so when they declare they want to do something or after they finish doing something.
      In special circumstances, the DM might ask you to make a Dexterity Check to be or remain Hidden.
      You can't become Hidden through non-Ability means.

          Notes: |
            E.g. if you Ambush the target and it also has 50% or less Health, the total Ambush Damage is 2d8 Damage. Or, for another example, if you were Hiding and you would also Ambush from your Specialization Ambush Ability condition, the attack gains 2d8 Damage.
            The maximum Damage is 2d8, even if you match 3 conditions for Ambush (e.g. Hiding, Savage Ambush and your Specialization's Ambush Ability).
            You can still add Ambush Damage only once per turn (e.g. not with 2 separate attacks; it must be one single attack).

            The maximum Damage is 2d8, even if you match 3 conditions for Ambush (e.g. Hiding, First-Shot Ambush and your Specialization's Ambush Ability).
            You can still add Ambush Damage only once per turn (e.g. not with 2 separate attacks; it must be one single attack).

          _Value: 3
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            After you use a 0 Actions Ability, your next weapon attack this turn gains Ambush.
            Ambush can happen twice per turn (even at the same time) from 2 different Ambush conditions.
          Notes: |
            E.g. if you just used a 0 Actions Ability but you would Ambush anyway, the Ambush Damage is 2d8 Damage. Or, for another example, if you were Hiding and you would also Ambush from your Specialization Ambush Ability condition, the attack gains 2d8 Damage.
            Or, if you were hiding and Ambush, then use a 0 Actions Ability, then attack again, that second attack also gains Ambush (1d8 extra Damage).

          Effect: |
            When you Flank an enemy, the attack gains Ambush.
            Ambush can apply twice at the same time, from 2 different Ambush conditions.
          Notes: |
            E.g. if the target has 50% or less Health and you're also Flanking it, the total Ambush Damage is 2d8 Damage. Or, for another example, if you were Hiding and the target would also have 50% or less Health, the attack gains 2d8 Damage.
            The maximum Damage is 2d8, even if you match 3 conditions for Ambush (e.g. Hiding, 50% Health and Flanking).
            You can still add Ambush Damage only once per turn (e.g. not with 2 separate attacks; it must be one single attack).
