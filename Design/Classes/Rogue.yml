# Idea: For each Mana spent on Ambush, X happens

Starting Abilities Description:
  - Ambush: |
      Ambush can normally happen only once per turn, and you can charge it up to deal more damage!
      However, your Rogue Specialization will give you extra ways to Ambush target!
  - Hide: |
      Essentially, you can interrupt another Unit's turn, put that unit on pause, and start your turn. When your turn ends, the Unit resumes its turn.
      Before you attack an enemy group, you can tell your DM where you are sitting, so that you benefit from cover.
  - Rogue Feats: |
      Nothing is stopping you from using a 2-Handed weapon instead of 1-Handed ones.
      There should be no downside to that.
      However, given that 1-Handed weapons are weaker than 2-Handed weapons, either one of the 2 feats will make wielding 1-Handed or 2-Handed weapons equally strong.
      
Starting Abilities:
  
  ~Ambush~ :      # 0.75
    AlignOnWebsite: Right
    A: Passive
    Effect: |
      If you start your turn Hidden, your first attack deals 1d8 extra damage.
      When Ambushing, you can also spend as much Mana as you want.
      That attack gains 1d8 extra damage for each Mana spent (on top of the 1d8).
      Ambush can only happen once per turn.
    Notes: |
      Your Specialization will give you extra ways to Ambush.
      You can't stack 2 Ambushes at the same time, obviously.

          When in a town or city, you convert all Gold Tokens to actual gold coins (1 Gold Token for 10 Gold) (this is done on a Long Rest).
