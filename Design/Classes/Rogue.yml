Class: Rogue
Description: |
  A hush falls over the bustling city square as a fat pig adorned in a lavish display of gold and diamonds walks around the corner, accompanied by a pair of brutish lackeys, oblivious to the imminent danger lurking in the shadows. concealed within his pocket rests a scroll containing privileged information for his eyes only, or so he believes. Now! A shadowy figure descends upon them, a poisoned blade finding its mark in the unsuspecting guard's back. Swift and precise strikes to the legs, a tap on the shoulder and a trick of the shadows renders the swine isolated in the dim alley. Flee, little pig, and squal in vain - your cries fall upon deaf ears.
  It is finished. A message stolen, and one conveyed. From whom? That is for the little pig and his friends to determine. After all, it was the quickest way for him to lose weight; he'll have an easier time trotting home.
  Rogues are masters of the shadows who focus on subtlety, teamwork or direct combat. While they don't directly cast magic, they can train in the strange arts of shadow techniques - scholars debate wether this is a form of the arcane, psionics or a mere trick of the light. Only rogues know.

Quick Note: Rogues are masters of the shadows who focus on subtlety, teamwork or direct combat. While they don't directly cast magic, they can train in the strange arts of shadow techniques - scholars debate wether this is a form of the arcane, psionics or a mere trick of the light. Only rogues know.

Armor Training: Light Armor

Weapons: You are Trained in 2 Weapon Categories of choice (e.g. 1-Handed Melee, 2-Handed Ranged, Shields, etc).

Difficulty: Easy

Language: |
  You know Doublespeak! Doublespeak is not exactly a language, but a way to carry out private conversations in public by using code words and phrases with double meaning, such that what you say is indistinguishable from a normal conversation. Doublespeak also has a written version; thieves, rogues and streetspeople might use deliberate writing mistakes, punctuation errors or scratch marks on buildings to warn or convey concepts or even entire sentences; these markings are indistinguishable from random scratches to the unaware. Doublespeak is an art in itself - even if every doublespeaker has their own mannerisms and idiosyncracies, one must know and recognize the patterns to be able to speak this language properly, and as such, some even consider it a poetic "language".

Proficiency Requirements: You have Skilled in Stealth and have a number of extra non-combat Skills equal to your Intelligence or Sense, whichever is higher.

Proficiencies:
    ~Skilled in Stealth~: Inherit
    
Proficiencies Description: |
    Rogues are naturally talented when it comes to subtlety. Skilled in stealth may come in handy particularily if the Quest Master ever issues you to roll a Check for remaining stealthed when you use Hide (an Ability you get as a Rogue, see below).

    Rogues can be experienced in many domains, from city dwelling to dungeoneering, so choose well!

Level Up:
  Every Level: 
    Health: 4


Spellcasting:
  Type: Rogue
  SpellsOrAbilities: Ability

  Mana:
    Regain: As a Hunter, you don't use Mana. You rely on weapons, class Abilities and simple Basic Spells.

  Change: You can change your known Spells and Talents inbetween Adventures.
  Other: All Rogue-specific Abilities are not considered Spells (unless stated otherwise).

  Known Basic Abilities: 2 + Intelligence (minimum 1)
  BaseKnownSpells: 2
  Basic Ability Lists:
    - Bloodshed
    - Warfare
  Recommended Basic Abilities:
    - Bloodshed: Shank
    - Bloodshed: Recuperate
    - Bloodshed: Slam
    - Warfare: Lightstrike

  Recommended Abilities Description: |
    Shank is there to help you spend your Mana in uncanny situations where you need just a little more damage to finish of an enemy. In case of an emergency, Recuperate is there to heal you, while Slam will deal area damage in case you're fighting multiple enemies. Finally, if you find out your enemies are resistant to your weapon attacks, get Lightstrike. It's situational, but it can be effective!

 
# Idea: In the first round of every combat, enemies can't target you with attacks or Abilities.
# Idea: For each Mana spent on Ambush, X happens
# Spec: Ambush procs when attacking a target you haven't attacked this combat
# Talents: Choose another condition for ambush and it gains +1d8 for that condition too

Starting Abilities Description:
  - Ambush: |
      Ambush can normally happen only once per turn, and you can charge it up to deal more Damage!
      However, your Rogue Specialization will give you extra ways to Ambush target!
  - Stalking: |
      Essentially, you can interrupt another Unit's turn, put that unit on pause, and start your turn. When your turn ends, the Unit resumes its turn.
      Before you attack an enemy group, you can tell your DM where you are sitting, so that you benefit from cover.
      
Starting Abilities:

    Effect: |
      On the first Round of combat, you can skip your Turn.
      Then, you can start your Turn whenever you like (even during enemies' turns)!
    Notes: |
      Be careful: if you don't start your Turn this Round, you lose your Turn!
      If you want to start during an enemy's Turn, you do so when they declare they want to do something or after they finish doing something.
