      When you would roll Initiative, you can instead roll Stealth.
      If you succeed, you become Hidden.
      While Hidden, you can unhide and start your turn whenever you like (even before or after a creature does something).
      If you started your turn during another creature's turn, that creature resumes its turn after your turn ends.
      After that, you take your turn when you normally would, next rounds.

      You become unhidden at the end of the round if you don't take your turn by then.
