Class: Warrior
Description: |
  With a resounding impact, the greatsword cleaves through the air, connecting with the beast's tail in a mighty blow. The wyvern wheels around, its massive jaws primed to ensnare the warrior in their deadly embrace. In a daring maneuver, the fighter relinquishes her blade, seizing the wyvern's jaw in a vice-like grip, diverting its momentum towards a nearby tree. She ascends onto the creature's head, plunging her blade deep into its eye with lethal precision. It is then that you observe a miraculous sight: her previously bloody wounds have miraculously sealed, as if cauterized by the scorching heat of battle and the coursing adrenaline of combat.
  Warriors are talented in using any type of weapon, with hand-to-hand combat capabilities way beyond the average adventurer. Brawn and tactics are a warrior's aces in the sleeve.
  A warrior is a physical combatant, but that does not stop them from overcoming challenges. With mastery over arms, body or range, a warrior may improvise and lead their way to victory.

  Basic Ability Lists:

  Recommended Basic Abilities:
    - Bloodshed: Recuperate
    - Bloodshed: Slam
    - Bloodshed: Chilling Shout
    - Bloodshed: Bull Rush
    - Warfare: Atonement

  Recommended Abilities Description: |
    Warriors should be able to withhold damage, and as such, we recommend Recuperate for some extra healing and breaking enemy effects on you. Slam will provide you with area damage and Chilling Shout is a great ranged attack for the Mana cost. If you still have more available Basic Spells, no-one ever complained about having Bull Rush - it's a great passive effect for dealing extra damage. Lastly, if your Sense is low, Atonement will be great in combat for survival, if you're expecting to take a lot of damage.


Starting Abilities:

  ~Vigor~:
    A: Passive
    Effect: |
      You start with 3 extra Max Health.

  ~Advanced Flank~ :
    _Value: 3
    AlignOnWebsite: Left
    A: Passive
    Effect: |
      The first time you Flank-Attack an enemy every turn, the attack deals 1d6 Damage instead of just +1.
      Also, your melee weapon attacks Flank an enemy if they are pinned against a wall or an obstacle as well.
    Note: |
      Flanking is when you melee-attack an enemy, and an ally of yours is directly behind the enemy.
      Also, instead of an ally being behind the enemy, your attacks count as Flanking even if there is a wall or another obstacle directly behind them.

  ~Charge~:
    _Value: 1
    AlignOnWebsite: Left
    A: 0 Actions
    HasMixins: true
    Range: 3 meters
    Cooldown: Once / Turn
    Effect: |
      Freely dash 1 up to 3 meters towards a Worthy Enemy, landing on the closest space. It becomes Fumbling.
      You can only use this once on every Worthy Enemy.

Starting Abilities Description:
  - Advanced Flank: |
      Warriors are great at using their teammates and the terrain to make flanking attacks!
      When an enemy is caught directly between you and another ally of yours, that attack counts as a Flank Attack, and it deals +1 Damage (normally). Your Advanced Flank transforms the +1 into 1d6 Damage to the first Flank Attack you make every turn!
      This works now if there is a wall or an obstacle directly behind your target, so use the environment to your advantage!
      Note that this only works for melee attacks and on enemies 1 meter away from you (e.g. enemies directly in front of you).

Specializations:
  Description: At Level 1, you can choose your specialization. Every Warrior can choose from the following Warrior specializations
  Choices:
    - Fighter, a person specialized in weapon fighting and body-to-body combat
    - Battlemaster, a heavily trained and armed warrior; master yourself - master the enemy
    - Barbarian, a crude and battle thirsty warrior, who seeks to shed blood and lives for the fight
    - Marksman, a precise and mechanical soldier, always finding the best tactic and position; the Marksman wins the battle before it begins

# Talent: (Fighter) - Your allies benefit from Advanced Flank with you and it's 1d8
# Talent: (Fighter) - While mounted, your melee attacks have 2 meters range and hit another target behind the first for 50% of the damage.

      <Quick Maneuvers>:
          _Value: 1
          A: Special
          Cooldown: Once / Turn
          Effect: Immediately after you make a weapon attack, use Sprint, Push, Taunt or Hamstring for free.
          Notes: Sprint (run up to 2 meters), Push (push a non-Epic medium-sized Unit 1 meter in any direction), Taunt (make a Unit have -2 on its next attack if it's not on you), Hamstring (slow a Unit).

      <Opportunity Attacks>:
          _Value: 0.75
          A: Reaction
          Effect: |
            When an enemy moves 1 or more meters away from near you, you can make a free attack on them with a 1-Handed Melee Weapon.
          Notes: If you don't have a 1-Handed Weapone equipped, you automatically freely equip one, attack with it, unequip it and equip what you previously had.

        <Might Over Magic>:
          _Value: 1
          A: Passive
          HasMixins: true
          Effect: |
            Choose one Basic Ability from the Elemental or Nature spell lists that costs 1 Mana.
            You can use that Ability once per Adventure (without spending Mana).
            That Ability becomes a ^physical version of itself^ instead of a spell: instead of using magic to cast that spell, you use your body/weapons/tools. The Damage of that spell becomes Slash, Smash or Pierce, whichever makes sense.
            Come up with a description of how it works!
          Notes: |
            E.g. Scorching Rays - you shoot 3 arrows with your bow (Pierce Damage).
            E.g. Frost Nova - you smash the ground with such force that it Damages and Slows units around you (Smash Damage).
            Be creative!
            
        <Weaponmaster> :          # 1 because it's bonkers on 1H weapons
          _Value: 1
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            Your weapon attacks have an extra effect.
            When you get this, choose one weapon effect from the list below.
            You also have that weapon effect on all weapons you use, exactly as written, no matter what weapon you are using.
            You can change this weapon effect between combats.
          Notes: |
            Pay very close attention to the weapon effect - for example, Katana specifies that you Critical Strike with it when all 3 dice have the same number, so this can only apply to weapons that roll exactly 3 dice. Or, for another example, Slings say that attacks specifically with Slings take 0.33 Actions, so it can not apply to any other weapon!
            Weapons stating "the die" (or such) now refer to any one die of the dice rolled, of choice (if multiple).

        <Into the Fray>:    # 2, maybe more
          _Value: 2.25
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
              When combat starts, determine which side is your Allied Side and which is the Enemy Side of the battlefield. Each side has a direction (Allied Direction and Enemy Direction).
              If you end your turn more to the Allied Direction than you started, you gain 4 Shielding until the start of your next turn.
              If you end your turn more to the Enemy Direction than you started, your first attack next turn deals 1d6 extra Damage.
                
        <Glory Run>:        # 2?
          _Value: 2.25
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
              When combat starts, a Glory Point appears behind the furthermost Enemy from you that you can see.
              If you touch the Glory Point, heal for 20% of your total Health and all Enemies you can see must become Dazed.
              The Glory Point then disappears.
          Notes:
              The Glory Point is not a physical thing. It's merely a concept (a point).
                
        <Ruining Throw>:
          _Value: 2
          A: Half-Action
          Range: 10 meters
          Cooldown: Once / Encounter
          Effect: |
              Throw a weapon at a target and attack it (without Throwing penalties and ignoring Cover).
              Before applying the Damage, the attack destroys all Shielding and Defense on the target and removes all buffs on it.
              The target can't trigger "on roll", can't gain Shielding and can't benefit from Buffs until they spend an Action to recover.
          Upgrade: Epic Monsters gain ther Defense back when they spend the Action to recover.
          Notes: |
              Your weapon lands at the nearest space to the target (and you should probably pick it up with a Half-Action).
              "On roll" refers to effects like "if it rolls 10 on a d10, the attack deals 1d10 extra Damage".
              Buffs are all effects that improve the target; even passive effects like auras or passive stats from abilities are negated.
              You don't need Training in Throwning and this attack counts as a regular melee attack.

      Level 7:
        
        <Personal Squire>:  # 2+
          _Value: 3
          A: Special
          Effect: |
            You recruit a squire - a trusted NPC who gains combat powers. However, the capabilities of your squire are random: roll 1d6 to determine the type of your squire, based on the Squires category at Pets and Animals (1. Bold, 2. Sneaky, 3. Clever, 4. Wise). The Race is determined by the QM or by circumstance.
            On its turn, it can do one Pet Attack, cast one Ability it has, or do the equivalent of a Half-Action (e.g. Dash, Push, etc).
            You can recruit one squire per Adventure, but only one can follow you in your adventures at a time.
            At the start of every Adventure (and when you get this Talent), you must spend 1 Mana and train your Squire to permanently increase its Health by 2 or gain one Ability from any other Squire type.
          Upgrade: If your squire drops to 0 Health, it becomes Fallen, like a player. It has no Health Regen, but at any point outside of combat, you (the pet owner) can spend 30 minutes to tend to your squire's wounds and heal it back to full Health.
          Notes: Your squire is not a Player Character by any means and does not behave like one (it can't use Weapons, Armor, Feats, Abilities, etc like a Player Character can). It is limited to what its stat block and Abilities say it can do. You can, however, give it orders, customize its looks (hair style, clothes, etc) and it will obey your commands within reason. You are the leader it looks up to. Lead proudly and fairly!

        <Attack Command>:   # 2+
          _Value: 2.25
          A: Reaction or 0 Actions
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure
          HasMixins: true
          Effect: |
            An ally immediately makes an Act that takes 1 Action (can spend Mana, Cooldowns, etc on it, as if it were on its turn).
            You can use this at any point, before or after someone does an Act.
            ^You^ roll all the dice for this Act.

        <MIGHT OVER MAAAGIC!!!>:  # 2
          _Value: 2
          A: Passive
          HasMixins: true
          Effect: |
            Choose ^TWO^ Basic Abilities from the Elemental, Nature or Eldritch Spell lists that cost 1 Mana.
            You can use each of those Abilities once per Adventure (without spending Mana).
