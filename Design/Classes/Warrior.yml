  Known Basic Abilities: 2 + Your Intelligence
  BaseKnownSpells: 2
  Basic Ability Lists:
    - Bloodshed
    - Warfare

  Recommended Basic Abilities:
    - Bloodshed: Recuperate
    - Bloodshed: Slam
    - Bloodshed: Chilling Shout
    - Bloodshed: Bull Rush
    - Warfare: Atonement

  Recommended Abilities Description: |
    Warriors should be able to withhold damage, and as such, we recommend Recuperate for some extra healing and breaking enemy effects on you. Slam will provide you with area damage and Chilling Shout is a great ranged attack for the Mana cost. If you still have more available Basic Spells, no-one ever complained about having Bull Rush - it's a great passive effect for dealing extra damage. Lastly, if your Main Stat is low, Atonement will be great in combat for survival, if you're expecting to take a lot of damage.


Starting Abilities:

  ~Advanced Flank~ :        # 1.75
    AlignOnWebsite: Left
    A: Passive
    Effect: |
      The first time you Flank-Attack an enemy every turn, the attack deals 1d6 Damage instead of just +1.
      Also, your melee weapon attacks Flank an enemy if they are pinned against a wall or an obstacle as well.
    Note: |
      Flanking is when you melee-attack an enemy, and an ally of yours is directly behind the enemy.
      Also, instead of an ally being behind the enemy, your attacks count as Flanking even if there is a wall or another obstacle directly behind them.

  ~Rout~:
    AlignOnWebsite: Left
    A: Passive
    Effect: |
      When you come within 1 meter of an Enemy, it instantly becomes Fumbling.
      Then it can't be affected by Rout for the rest of the combat.
    Note: |
      Multiple Warriors can't Rout the same Unit multiple times.
      Rout happens when you are not in an Enemy's vicinity, and you move (or are moved) and enter its vicinity. You don't need to end your movement there to trigger Rout on it - you can enter then exit its vicinity and Rout will trigger on it.

Starting Abilities Description:
  - Advanced Flank: |
      Warriors are great at using their teammates and the terrain to make flanking attacks!
      When an enemy is caught directly between you and another ally of yours, that attack counts as a Flank Attack, and it deals +1 Damage (normally). Your Advanced Flank transforms the +1 into 1d6 Damage to the first Flank Attack you make every turn!
      This works now if there is a wall or an obstacle directly behind your target, so use the environment to your advantage!
      Note that this only works for melee attacks and on enemies 1 meter away from you (e.g. enemies directly in front of you).

Specializations:
  Description: At Level 1, you can choose your specialization. Every Warrior can choose from the following Warrior specializations
  Choices:
    - Fighter, a person specialized in weapon fighting and body-to-body combat
    - Battlemaster, a heavily trained and armed warrior; master yourself - master the enemy
    - Barbarian, a crude and battle thirsty warrior, who seeks to shed blood and lives for the fight
    - Marksman, a precise and mechanical soldier, always finding the best tactic and position; the Marksman wins the battle before it begins

    Description: Lorem!
    Starting Abilities:

      ~Upper Hand~ :              # 0.35
        A: Passive
        Effect: |
          Your first attack you make before you move in a turn counts as if it is Flanking, regardless if it would be Flanking normally or not.
          When an enemy becomes Fumbling by moving away from you, you can make a free attack on them with a 1-Handed Melee Weapon (with your Reaction).
        Notes: When doing this, you don't need to have the 1-Handed Melee Weapon equipped; you simply use it for the attack (then instantly unequip it and equip what you had previously).

      ~Overpower~ :               # Ok
        A: 0 Actions
        Cost: 1 Mana
        Cooldown: Once per turn
        Effect: |
          Gain an additional Half-Action this turn.

    Talents:
      Level 3:

        <Might Over Magic>:     # 1
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            Choose an Advanced spell from the Elemental spell list that deals Damage.
            You can cast that spell once per Adventure.
            That spell becomes a physical version of itself.
            Instead of using magic to cast that spell, you use your body/weapons/tools.
            Come up with a description of how it works (see notes).
            The Damage of that spell becomes Slash, Smash or Pierce, whichever makes sense.
            It is not considered a Spell.
          Notes: |
            E.g. Scorching Rays - you shoot 3 arrows with your bow (Pierce Damage).
            E.g. Frost Nova - you smash the ground with such force that it Damages and slows units around you (Smash Damage).
            Be creative!
            
        <Weaponmaster> :          # 1 because it's bonkers on 1H weapons
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            When you get this, choose one weapon type.
            You have that weapon effect too on all weapons you use, exactly as written, no matter what weapon you are using.
            You can change this weapon type inbetween Adventures.
          Notes: Pay very close attention to the weapon effect - for example, Katana specifies that you Critical Strike with it when all 3 dice have the same number, so this can only apply to weapons that roll exactly 3 dice. Or, for another example, Slings say that attacks specifically with Slings take 0.33 Actions, so it can not apply to any other weapon!

        <Quick Maneuvers>:
          A: 0 Actions
          Cooldown: Once / Turn
          Effect: Immediately after you make a weapon attack, use Dash, Push, Taunt or Hamstring for free. The target rolls no Check - it is applied instantly.

      Level 5:
        
        <Into the Fray>:    # 2, maybe more
            A: Passive
            Effect: |
                When combat starts, determine which side is your Allied Side and which is the Enemy Side of the battlefield. Each side has a direction (Allied Direction and Enemy Direction).
                If you end your turn more to the Allied Direction than you started, you gain 4 Shielding until the start of your next turn.
                If you end your turn more to the Enemy Direction than you started, your first attack next turn deals 1d6 extra Damage.
                
        <Glory Run>:        # 2?
            A: Passive
            Effect: |
                When combat starts, a Glory Point appears behind the furthermost Enemy from you that you can see.
                If you touch the Glory Point, heal for 20% of your total Health and all Enemies you can see must pass a Charisma Check or be Crippled.
                The Glory Point then disappears.
            Notes:
                The Glory Point is not a physical thing. It's merely a concept (a point).
                
        <Ruining Throw>:
            A: Half-Action
            Range: 10 meters
            Cooldown: Once / Encounter
            Effect: |
                Throw a weapon at a target and attack it (without Throwing penalties and ignoring Cover).
                Before applying the Damage, the attack destroys all Shielding and Defense on the target and removes all buffs on it.
                The target is unable to trigger "on roll", can't gain Shielding and can't benefit from Buffs until they spend an Action to recover.
            Upgrade: Epic Monsters gain ther Defense back when they spend the Action to recover.
            Notes: |
                Your weapon lands at the nearest space to the target (and you should probably pick it up with a Half-Action).
                "On roll" refers to effects like "if it rolls 10 on a d10, the attack deals 1d10 extra Damage".
                Buffs are all effects that improve the target; even passive effects like auras or passive stats from abilities are negated.
                You don't need Training in Throwning and this attack counts as a regular melee attack.
