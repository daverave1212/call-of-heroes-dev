Class: Hunter
Description: |
  As you evade an oncoming arrow, your focus shifts, leaving you vulnerable to the sudden onslaught of a raptor lunging at your throat. A whirlwind of steel and fang ensues, and as a sword is close to striking you, the attack suddenly stops. "You're no monster" he says as he unsheathes his sword, searching for tracks in the mud. "Best mind your own business, friend. The one I'm seeking is nearby... and it is seeking you."
  Hunters are keen predators, who fight alongside one (or multiple) trusted beastly companions. While able to cast some rudimentary magic, spellcasting is not their focus, and they more than make up in terms of raw ferocity and power to kill.
  A hunter can always navigate their surroundings, and can track down any monster, or person alike, no matter the scope.

Difficulty: Medium

Weapons: You are Trained in 2 Weapon Categories of choice (e.g. 1-Handed Melee, 2-Handed Ranged, Shields, etc).

Proficiency Requirements: You have Skilled in Hearing, Smelling and have a number of extra non-combat Skills equal to your Intelligence or Sense, whichever is higher.

Proficiencies:
    ~Skilled in Hearing~: Inherit
    ~Skilled in Smelling~: Inherit

Level Up:

Spellcasting:
  Type: Hunter
  SpellsOrAbilities: Ability
    
  Spell Grade: 6 + Sense
  Change: You can change your known Spells and Talents inbetween Adventures.
  Other: All Hunter-specific Abilities are not considered Spells (unless stated otherwise).

  Mana:
    Regain: As a Hunter, you don't use Mana. You rely on weapons, class Abilities and simple Basic Spells.

  Known Basic Abilities: 1 + Intelligence (minimum 1)
  
  BaseKnownSpells: 1
  
  
  Basic Ability Lists:
    - Bloodshed
    - Warfare
    - Nature

  Recommended Basic Abilities:
    - Nature: Cure Affliction
    - Nature: Resistance
    - Nature: Venin Shot
    - Bloodshed: Slam

  Recommended Abilities Description: |
    As a Hunter, your baseline kit with the pet and Class Abilities is very strong, but you are what some would call a "semi-caster" - a class with low access to magic and Abilities, so you need to work with what you've got! Resistance is a decent defensive option and Venin Shot might help dish out some more Damage. Cure Affliction can be amazing in certain niche scenarios, and Slam will help you deal with multiple opponents at once - just be careful not to slam into your allies!

 

Starting Abilities:

  ~Animal Companion~:
    _Value: 4.5
    AlignOnWebsite: Left
    A: Passive
    HasMixins: true
    Effect: |
      You have an animal pet that can fight alongside you! Check out the `Pets and Animals page$/Other/PetsAndAnimals` and choose an Animal from the Pets section, ignoring those Level requirements!
      Your pet takes its turn at the same time as you do, and always has the same Initiative as yours, and can make normal Checks using using its own Stats.
      It has 1 Action per turn, which it can use to do its own Abilities or Pet Attack.
      Your pet will not stray more than 30 meters away from you in hostile territory.
    Upgrade: If your pet drops to 0 Health, it becomes Fallen, like a player. It has no Health Regen, but at any point outside of combat, you (the pet owner) can spend 30 minutes to tend to your pet's wounds and heal it back to full Health.
    Notes: |
      Your pet can't rise from being Fallen while in combat, even if healed.
      If your pet ever dies, you can spend 8 hours inbetween Adventures to get a new pet. If you want to change your Pet and abandon your current one, you can do so inbetween Adventures, but the guilt will make you Fumbling for the next 2 Worthy Combat encounters.

      As a Hunter, you always have your trusted Animal Companion with you.

      Tumble allows you to dodge-roll to avoid some of the Damage.

    Starting Abilities:

        ~Prowl Around~:
          A: Passive
          _Value: 0.5
          Effect: |
            You have +2 to all Sense Checks.
          Notes: This is because of your Animal Companions roaming about.
        
        ~Stablemaster~:
          _Value: 1
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            You have 3 different Animal Companion pets, but only one can adventure with you at a time.
            While not with you, your other Animal Companions hang out on their own in the wilderness, but no more than 5 kilometers away from you.
            You can send your current companion off, then spend 30 minutes to telepathically call another one to come join you.
          Notes: |
            The advantage is you can use several animal Abilities that have longer Cooldowns; these are usually stronger.
            It is possible that the animal you're calling can't come to your aid if you're indoors, flying or the trail you're on is too difficult. In that case, you will have to return outside or on a safe trail (QM's decision).
            In that case, your current companion can not go away, either.

          Effect: |
            One more of your Animal Companions accompanies you while adventuring.
            This Animal Companion obeys the same rules as the regular one (takes its turns, requires healing between combats, etc).
            One of your 3 Animal Companions can be an Exotic Animal.
          Notes: You're instantly kicked from the group if your pets don't have names.

          Effect: |
            One more of your Animal Companions accompanies you while adventuring.
            This Animal Companion obeys the same rules as the regular one (takes its turns, requires healing between combats, etc).
            One of your 3 Animal Companions grows to become Large. Its Max Health increases by 25% and its attack range by 1.

        <Wild Single>:
          _Value: 5
          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            All your Animal Companions are combinations of 2 different Animals from the Animals List, and have the highest Stats of the two and both Abilities, and has 100% extra Health. All your Animal Companions must be combinations of all different Animals.
            Your Animal Companion's Pet Attack Damage becomes 2d6.

          _Value: 2.25
          A: 1 Action
          Cooldown: Once / Adventure
          Effect: |
            One pet makes a melee Attack for 5d6 Slash Damage.
            If the target is at or below 50% Health, deal 2d6 extra Damage and the target halves all healing it receives for the rest of the encounter.
          Notes: This takes 1 Action from YOU, not your pet.
          
        <Sickem>:
          _Value: 2.5
          A: Reaction
          Effect: |
            Use when a Unit goes flying against its will on someone else's turn.
            Your pet(s) within 5 meters of its landing place can dash to it (after it lands) and make a total of 2 Pet Attacks on it.
          Notes: |
            Goes flying means is pushed, knocked up, dragged, etc.
            This uses YOUR Reaction, not your pets'.
            Obviously, the pets need line of sight and can't jump through walls, or over large obstacles. Apply common sense.
