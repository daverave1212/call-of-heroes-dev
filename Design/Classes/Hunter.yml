      ~Tracker~ :   # 0.25 Charges
        A: Passive
        Effect: |
          You can more easily track creatures and when you try to track a creature, your roll for that try gains +3. If you succeed, you may learn about its size, how many of them there are, if it's injured or roughly how far away it is.

        Notes: |
          Increasing dice by 1 tier means, for example, d6 become d8, or d10 become d12.

          A: Passive
          Effect: |
            You have an animal pet that can fight alongside you!
            Your animal has stats depending on its species. Check out the Pets and Animals page to see its stats!
            Your pet takes its turn at the same time as you do, and always has the same initiative as yours.
            Your pet has 1 Action per turn, which it can use to do its own Abilities.
            Your pet can make normal Checks using using its own Stats.
            Your pet will not stray more than 30 meters away from you in hostile territory.
            All pets have the Pet Attack ability.
          # Pets can't make Opportunity Attacks.
          Upgrade: If your pet drops to 0 Health, it becomes Fallen, like a player. It has no reserve Health, but at any point outside of combat, you (the pet owner) can spend 30 minutes to tend to your pet's wounds and heal it back to full Health.
          Notes: |
            If your pet raises from being Fallen, it has Pet Exhaustion (is Slowed and can only use Pet Attack, but all Pet Attacks have Cover, which is a -2 to the attack).
            Treat your pet like a real companion - give it a name and care for it. If it ever dies, you can spend 2 days looking for another wild animal and taming it to become your new pet.

                For each meter to the target over 7 meters, deal one less d6.
            Notes: At exactly 7 meters range, the attack deals 7d6 damage. At 6 and 8 meters, it deals 6d6. At 4 and 9 meters, 5d6. And so on.

                They take half the damage and are Slowed if they pass.
            Notes: The floor and ceiling are not considered a wall. The wave does not travel through them. This is considered a Spell. Ignores Cover.

            Perform an attack with a 1-Handed weapon.
            This attack ignores Cover and has no pentaly if you're Blinded.
            This attack does not trigger attacks of oportunity and can be used in melee range without penalty if it's a ranged weapon.

          Effect: After you Tumble or Parry, your next Attack has the dice tiers increased.
          Notes: |
              For example, instead of 2d6, an attack would be 2d8.
              D12's and d20's don't increase; they stay d12 and d20.
              This only affects Attacks. If an Ability tells you to Attack, then it applies.
              For example, Quick Magic is not an attack.

          # Pets don't provoke Opportunity Attacks when dashing like this.
          Notes: |
            Goes flying means is pushed, knocked up, dragged, etc.
            This uses YOUR Reaction, not your pets'.
            Obviously, the pets need line of sight and can't jump through walls, or over large obstacles. Apply common sense.
