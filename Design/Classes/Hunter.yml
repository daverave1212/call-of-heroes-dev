          o You can more easily track creatures.
          When you try to track a creature, your roll for that try gains +3.

            Perform an attack with a 1-Handed weapon.
            This attack ignores Cover and has no pentaly if you're Blinded.

          IsSubspell: true
          A: Passive
          Effect: After you Tumble or Parry, your next Attack has the dice tiers increased.
          Notes: |
              For example, instead of 2d6, an attack would be 2d8.
              D12's don't increase, they stay d12.
              This only affects Attacks. If an Ability tells you to Attack, then it applies.
              For example, Quick Magic is not an attack.

            Notes: |
                The wall pushes objects or willing Units away from it and can be used as a platform.
                If you decide to place it horizontally, it acts as Hard Terrain.

            Your pet(s) within 5 meters of its landing place can dash to it (after it lands) and make a total of 3 Pet Attacks on it.
            Pets don't provoke Opportunity Attacks when dashing like this.
          Notes: |
            Goes flying means is pushed, knocked up, dragged, etc.
            This uses YOUR Reaction, not your pets'.
            Obviously, the pets need line of sight and can't jump through walls, or over large obstacles. Apply common sense.
