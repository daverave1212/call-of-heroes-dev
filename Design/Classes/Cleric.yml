  Life Cleric:            # +0.85
    Description: You are a worshipper of life and/or death. Seek their balance, and seek balance within yourself.\nYou have a Second Soul character, which is essentially another toned-down character you play.
    Starting Abilities:
    
      ~Second Soul~:
        A: Special
        Effect: |
          You have another character beside you, your 'minion', that is either a celestial or an undead.
          Its stat block is dictated by your starting Ability choice below.

    Choose your side: Life Cleric!\nPick only one of the following two abilities!

    Abilities:
    
      ~True Necromancy~:      # 1.5; The damage is abysmal and it shares health and all.
        A: Special
        HasMixins: true
        Effect: |
          Your minion is a reanimated humanoid, whose soul is compelled to stay in this plane until its purpose is met.
          
          The minion draws power from your own spirit: it shares the same {Health} Health pool with you (e.g. whenever one of you takes damage, the other one takes it as well). It also always has the same {Defense} Defense and Checks as you, and has Speed equal to your base Speed.
          Your minion has a 1-Handed Melee weapon. On its turn, it can attack once with it for 1d8 {Damage} Damage without any Stat modifiers, regardless of the weapon's real damage. It does, however, apply weapon effects.
          It takes its turn at the same time as you.
          
          On your turn, you can also cast any Spell through your Minion for range purposes only.
        Notes: |
          Instead of attacking, your minion can do the equivalent of a Half-Action for non-combat uses, like using a potion, throwing a rope, reloading a weapon, etc, but not using a scroll. It can also use Disengage or Dash.
          If both of you take damage at the same time (e.g. from an AoE effect), the damage taken is equal to the average of the damages taken.
          It needs to rest and drink water normally, but does not require food.
          Come up with a story about why you have an Undead minion and why your god allowed this or gave him or her to you. Your undead minion might still be sentient (or not; your choice). If it is sentient, your GM might allow it to speak multiple languages, depending on the plot and theme of the campaign. The GM might also allow it to have separate Stats from yours using the normal Stat distribution, for Check purposes only (e.g. it won't affect Health). Alternatively, you can choose your minion to be an animal (for aesthetic purposes only).
          
      # ~2.5; Better than Animate Dead in all aspects (which costs 1 Action, 1 Mana);
      # It can do 3 attacks worth of slightly less than 0.5 Actions each (~1.25 Actions total)
      ~Celestial Follower~:
        A: 0 Actions
        Cooldown: Long Rest
        Duration: 3 turns
        HasMixins: true
        Effect: |
          Your minion is an angelic being, whose task is to protect guide or follow you until its purpose is met and is always by your side in the form of a spirit nobody else can interact with. Your Celestial follower can be a humanoid or animal in appearance (it can't fly) and is sentient.
          Using 0 Actions, you can summon your minion in the physical plane, materializing in a space you choose within 5 meters, and lasts up to 3 turns.
          
          It has {Health} Health equal to 10 + Your Level + Your Charisma, 3 {Defense} Defense, 5 Speed, 0 Initiative and the same Stats are you for Check purposes.
          On its turn, it can attack, either Melee for 2d6 True {Damage} Damage, or ranged for 1d10 True {Damage} Damage (6 meters range).
          Alternatively, on its turn, instead of Attacking, it can cast Awe once for free (with your current Awe dice tier, if it's not 1d4).
          
          It takes its turn separately, and always has 0 Initiative.
        Notes: |
          The Celestial Follower dematerializes after it finishes taking its 3rd turn.
          Instead of attacking, your minion can do the equivalent of a Half-Action for non-combat uses, like using a potion, throwing a rope, reloading a weapon, etc, but not using a scroll. It can also use Disengage or Dash.
          You can choose the aspect of your minion (e.g. sentient humanoid, animal, etc).
          Come up with a story about why you have an angel follower.
