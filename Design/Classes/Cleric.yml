Class: Cleric
Description: |
  In the tumult of battle, you suffer grievous wounds, tumbling injured to the ground. Amidst the chaos, however, a beacon of hope catches your eye across the battlefield. Drawing nearer, you discern a figure brandishing a sacred symbol, poised to intervene in your plight. With a decisive strike, they confront your assailant and then approach, kneeling by your side. Yet disquieting feeling overtakes you - this cleric's powers are not of the same god as yours. All gods demand something... what will this one demand of you for bringing you back on your feet?
  Clerics are spellcasters deeply attuned to their religion, and while their magic source may be from a divine source, they nevertheless possess an understanding to wield magic, and more often than not, they have learned the secrets of their creed, and can put them to good use to attain their life's purpose.
  A Cleric is a guide, a seeker of understandings. Clerics have the innate ability to heal and cause harm, and every cleric has the option to embrace either side of the coin - war or peace, light or darkness, life or death. While they usually serve a greater god, no two clerics are alike, and each has their own way of worship and path in life.
