    Description: You are a worshipper of life and/or death. Seek their balance, and seek balance within yourself.\nYou have a Second Soul character, which is essentially another toned-down character you play.
    Starting Abilities:
    
      ~Second Soul~:      # 1, but -2 = 1
        _Value: 1
        A: Special
        Effect: |
          You have another Unit beside you, your companion.
          Your companion draws power from your own spirit: it shares the same Health pool with you (e.g. whenever one of you takes Damage, the other one takes it as well). It also always has the same Defense and Checks as you, and has Speed equal to your base Speed.
          Your companion has a 1-Handed Melee weapon. On its turn, it has a Half-Action which it can use to attack for 1d6 Damage without any Stat modifiers, regardless of the weapon's real Damage. It does, however, apply weapon effects, if any.
          It takes its turn at the same time as you.          
        Downside: Your maximum Mana decreases by 2.
        Notes: |
          Instead of attacking, your minion can do the equivalent of a Half-Action for non-combat uses, like using a potion, throwing a rope, reloading a weapon, etc, but not using a scroll. It can also use Dash or Defend.
          If both of you take Damage at the same time (e.g. from an AoE effect), the Damage taken is equal to the average of the Damages taken.
          Come up with a story about why you have your companion and why your god allowed this or gave them to you.
