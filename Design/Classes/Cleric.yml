  Life Cleric:            # 1 (because of the Mana decrease; would've been more like 2 usually)
    Description: You are a worshipper of life and/or death. Seek their balance, and seek balance within yourself.\nYou have a Second Soul character, which is essentially another toned-down character you play.
    Starting Abilities:
    
      ~Second Soul~:
        A: Special
        Effect: |
          You have another Unit beside you, your companion.
          Your companion draws power from your own spirit: it shares the same Health pool with you (e.g. whenever one of you takes damage, the other one takes it as well). It also always has the same Defense and Checks as you, and has Speed equal to your base Speed.
          Your companion has a 1-Handed Melee weapon. On its turn, it can attack once with it for 1d8 Damage without any Stat modifiers, regardless of the weapon's real damage. It does, however, apply weapon effects.
          It takes its turn at the same time as you.          
        Downside: Your maximum Mana decreases by 1.
        Notes: |
          Instead of attacking, your minion can do the equivalent of a Half-Action for non-combat uses, like using a potion, throwing a rope, reloading a weapon, etc, but not using a scroll. It can also use Disengage, Dash or Defend.
          If both of you take damage at the same time (e.g. from an AoE effect), the damage taken is equal to the average of the damages taken.
          Come up with a story about why you have your companion and why your god allowed this or gave them to you.

    Choose your side: Life Cleric!\nPick only one of the following two abilities!

    Abilities:

      ~Partner in Life~:  # 1
        A: Special
        Effect: |
          Your companion is an alive being. It can either be a sentient humanoid of any race (without affecting its stats) or an animal.
          Choose two of the following boons. Your companion will have them forever:
          - Sentience - Your companion is sentient and intelligent, and gains the Mana Tap Ability from the Elf Race
          - Largeness - Your companion is Large and starts every combat with Shielding equal to your Level (lasts until the end of the combat)

          - Opportunity Attacks - When an enemy becomes Fleeing from exiting your companion's melee attack range, your companion can make an attack on it with its Reaction
        Notes: |
          While riding your companion, it can still attack, but mounting and dismounting takes either a Half-Action or all of your own total Movement.
          Note that the Shielding (if you choose it) is on your companion, not on you; it absorbs Damage only if your companion takes it. If you're both hit at the same time, the Shielding applies.
      
      ~True Necromancy~:  # 1
        A: Special
        Effect: |
          Your companion is an undead. It can either be a sentient undead humanoid of any race (without affecting its stats) or an abstract undead creature.

          - Largeness - Your companion is Large and starts every combat with Shielding equal to your Level (lasts until the end of the combat)
          - Ghostly - Your companion takes only 50% Slashing and Necrotic Damage 
          - Sweeping - Instead of attacking, your Companion can just do 3 Damage (of its weapon type) to all Units within 2 meters of it
          - Death Burst - For 0 Actions, you can sacrifice your companion to cast Awe on all Units within 5 meters of it (this has a Long Rest Cooldown). Your Companion stays dead until your next Long Rest.
          - Corpsewalk - Once per turn, when your companion walks over a corpse, cast Awe on an enemy within 1 meter of your companion and the corpse is destroyed.
        Notes: |
          Note that the Shielding (if you choose it) is on your companion, not on you; it absorbs Damage only if your companion takes it. If you're both hit at the same time, the Shielding applies.

            A: Special
            Effect: |
                When you become a Lich, you place your soul inside a Phylactery - a special object, dear to you.
                When you would reach 0 Health, instead of going Fallen, you can instantly teleport your body inside the Phylactery.
                A spellcaster can channel during a whole Long Rest to resummon you near the Phylactery with full Health, Spells, etc.
                If the Phylactery is destroyed, you must wait 1 year to make another one.
            Notes: The Long Rest still applies to the channeler who revives you, and to you as well.
