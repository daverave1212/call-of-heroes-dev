	Puzzle/Challenge Ideas

  Players first see the wall, then they find the explosives in another room.
o River Cross
o Area is flooded with vinegar / sand (with mobs ofc >:)
o The Cthulhu door. A sentient door that can speak, but isnt very smart.
	It reads "The word is Cthulhu". Players must make the door say 'Cthulhu'
o Room is filled with 'reverse' pits. Stepping on a pressure plate shoots the ground up.
	To get up you must activate all pressure plates.
	But be careful, because it shoots up fast, like a god damn gun!
o Magnetic corridor. Have fun!
o Sound barrier : make loud noises to break it!
o Vampire mirror : It also has a corpse in front of it >:)
