  Exotic Pets

|Dragon Wyrm| : Pet
This small to medium sized dragon has a color and an element specific to it (Fire/Cold/Lightning/Acid).
That element is called the Dragon Wyrm Element.
Stats: 2/2/3/2/2
  ~Arcane Blood~ :
    A: Passive
    Effect: You and your pet have +2 Arcana.
  ~Element Resistance~ :
    A: Passive
    Effect: You and your pet have 50% resistance to the Dragon Wyrm Element.
  ~Dragon's Breath~ :     # Worth for 2 targets, not worth for 1
    A: 1 Action
    Cooldown: Long Rest
    Effect: |
      The pet breathes its Dragon Wyrm Element in a 3x1 meter line.
      Targets roll a DC12 Dexterity save.
      They take 2d6 damage if they fail, and half of that if they succeed.
  ~Take Flight~:
    A: Special
    Effect: |
      Your pet is smart enough to scout the surrounding area.
      For 15 minutes, the Dragon Wyrm flies around up to 100 meters in radius from your position and then returns to its owner, transmiting non-verbally what the dragon saw or felt and if there is danger (up to the DM how much information this can convey).
      Make a Perception roll for this (with your stat or the dragon's) and add +3.
      Can only be used out-doors.
    Downside:
      Can only be used while resting.

		
		You can do this once per Long Rest.
