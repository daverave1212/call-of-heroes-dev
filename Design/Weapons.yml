  Weapon Runes: |
    Any weapon can be inscribed with 1 rune. A rune is destroyed when used to inscribe a weapon, and inscribing a rune onto a weapon replaces the previous rune (if there was any).
    Standard runes (like the ones below) can be purchased from most regular stores.
  One-Handed Melee: Any character can freely use any One-Handed Weapon, as long as the Stat requirements are met. Attacks with One-Handed Weapons only use a Half-Action, so you can make 2 attacks on your turn, even with the same weapon!
  Two-Handed Melee: Any character can freely use any Two-Handed Weapon, as long as the Stat requirements are met. Attacks with Two-Handed Weapons use 1 Action.
  One-Handed Ranged: Any character can freely use One-Handed Weapon, as long as the Stat requirements are met. Attacks with One-Handed Weapons only use a Half-Action, so you can make 2 attacks on your turn, even with the same weapon!
  Two-Handed Ranged: Any character can freely use any Two-Handed Weapon, as long as the Stat requirements are met. Attacks with Two-Handed Weapons use 1 Action.
