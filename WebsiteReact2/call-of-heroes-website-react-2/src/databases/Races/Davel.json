    "Description": "Davels are demon people, but their ancestry can be Fey demons, underground demons, etc.\nDavels' looks shift according to their beliefs and what drives them in life. A warrior Davel might have his horns turn ram-like, and nose might flatten to look more like a bull and might have a shorter, bulkier tail.\n\nA Cleric Davel's horns might grow in a circle and form a halo, while their eyes turn bright yellow.\nA depressed Davel's hair might turn gray and straight, and horns might start pointing downward.\nA Druid Davel's horns might start to resemble a stag horns, while their tails' end might start resembling a leaf.\nA Warlock Davel's feet might start to resemble hooves, and their nails - claws.\n\nThus, it is somewhat easy to understand a Davel's drives and beliefs by looking at them.\nIt's hard for Davels to lie, but they are great at ommiting truth - the best way to deceive is by tellig the truth, with a lie here and there.\nTheir lifespan also depends on their beliefs and morals; a Davel driven by meditation and peace will live considerably longer, while a Davel dark mage's lifespan will be significantly shorter.\n",
