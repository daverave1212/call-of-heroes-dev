    "Description": "You are distracted by the words of a random tiny woman adressig you: \"Hey there! Nice to meet you! Who are you? Never mind, good luck on your travels! Ok, bye!\". She then just... leaves? Strange as it might seem, you're used to the eccentricities of Gnomes. These short and cheerful beings possess a unique nature that sets them apart from other races in the realm.\nGnomes, unlike regular mortals, do not age like people do. In fact, they can theoretically live indefinitely. However, their immortality comes with an intriguing twist: they age when burdened with negative emotions. As a result, they strive to maintain a state of perpetual happiness, embracing life's joys and avoiding negativity whenever possible. This philosophy fuels their zest for life, leading them to seek out new adventures and experiences.\nIn addition, Gnomes possess a heightened perception of the world around them. They see a broader spectrum of light and colors, which makes their surroundings appear vibrant and enchanting. Furthermore, their dreams at night are exceptionally vivid, bordering on hallucinatory experiences. It is through these intense dreams that Gnomes gain inspiration and creativity, enabling them to weave captivating tales and stories that leave others spellbound.\nWhile Gnomes may seem socially awkward and unrefined to other races, their peculiar joy for life often manifests in a way that is both strange and uncanny. They possess a childlike curiosity and an insatiable desire to explore, leading them to taste everything they come across\u2014even mud and rocks! Surprisingly, Gnomes lack a sense of taste, allowing them to consume a wide variety of substances without any repulsion. This adaptability, both in their diet and their overall approach to life, makes them excellent companions on adventures, always eager to see more, hear more, and taste more.\n",
