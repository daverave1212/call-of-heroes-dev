    "Race": "Elf",
    "Description": "As an arrow whizzes past, narrowly grazing a strand of your hair and embedding itself in a nearby tree, a magical residue lingers in its wake. Eyes peeled for its source, you don't see where, but you know who: Elves. This was a warning shot.\nElves, tall and slender beings, embody an innate elegance that seems to flow through their every movement. They possess a discerning nature, categorizing their own tribes based on the environments they call home, and this comes with a prejudice that runs deep in their societies. Wood Elves, deeply attuned to the natural world, find solace amidst the verdant embrace of ancient forests. Hy Elves, on the other hand, thrive in the bustling energy of cities, harnessing their keen intellect and adaptability to flourish amidst the urban landscape. And in the depths beneath the earth, the Drough Elves navigate the hidden realms, where shadows and secrets intertwine.\nUnlike most races, Elves do not sleep, but rather, they enter a meditative state to rejuvenate their spirits and minds. Deprived of the realm of dreams, their minds remain sharply focused on the present, always attuned to the world around them. This heightened awareness intertwines with their natural affinity for magic. Whether drawing upon the ancient forces of nature or delving into the depths of arcane arts, Elves possess an inherent connection to the mystical energies that course through the realms.\n",
