A QM might run a story based on the Lord of the Rings books or in some made up world. Some QM's have different styles of playing - some are more focused on telling a story, others are more focused on giving the players options. Some are friendly, some... less so.\nUltimately, just like finding a group to play board games with, you all should have roughly the same expectations and mindset. Some games are more relaxed, drinking and eating pizza. Some are more intense and take things seriously. If you find a group, make sure you ask what kind of group they are.\n\nMost groups have one Quest Master and between 3 and 6 other players who play as individual characters.\nThe recommended sweet spot for Questguard is one Quest Master and 4 to 5 other players.\n\nA play session can last as long as the group desires. Usually, you should dedicate at least 1:30 to 2 hours to a play session. A lot of players find they want to keep going after that, since time flies fast when you're having fun and making progress through the story!\n\nQuestguard has a dedicated community on Discord where we always organize new campaigns and sessions for players both new and old.\n"

But fret not; since Questguard is mainly inspired by Dungeons and Dragons, you fill find a lot of people who play D&D and will be willing to try CoH with you!\nThe easiest way to get started is to find someone who already knows how to play Questguard and ask to join their game, or ask them to host a game for you and some other friends.\nIf you want to try Questguard specifically and you have experience with Dungeons and Dragons (5th edition or One D&D), see the page \"D&D to CoH transition guide\". It will provide you an easy introduction to Questguard from a D&D perspective.\nIf you never played a tabletop RPG but you have friends who have played Dungeons and Dragons, send them a link to the \"D&D to CoH transition guide\" page!\nIf you decide to play online, there are several platforms for playing Questguard that simulate real life tables with miniatures, dice, music, etc. As of 2023, the most popular such platform is Roll20 (https://roll20.net). It is free for all players and Quest Masters alike and supports many roleplaying games, including Questguard.\n"

Playing the Game, explaining what you can do on sessions and on your turn in combat. Core Rules (In-Depth) is a glossary of all rules of the game, in-depth, with specific circumstances and situations and disambiguations. Finally, there is the Quest Master Guidlines, which contains tips and tricks for how to be a Quest Master.\nYou will see duplicate rules ocassionally (same rule in several places) as a reminder or as to reinforce a concept.\n\nFeel free to follow this guide to learn how to play the game. Both in the book and on the official website, you will find clarifications for each and every rule. When in doubt, search it up on the website or consult the table of contents of the book for that rule.\nAside from this written guide, there is also a video guide for both new and experienced roleplayers on our official YouTube channel or on the official Questguard website.\n\nTo be a player in a game, you need a Character! Don't worry about creating a character for now.\nFor the rest of this guide, assume you are playing as a short and skinny, sneaky Gnome. That is your character! We'll name him Don. Yes, in this story, you are Don.\n"

                        "value": "Before we begin, you need to know about dice.\nDice rolling is a core component of Questguard. Whatever you want to do, it is likely you will need to roll a die for it to determine if you succeed or fail, either as a Player Character or as an NPC or monster.\nIn the world of tabletop roleplaying, there exists one standard set of \"polyhedral\" dice - whether they are Dungeons and Dragons dice or Pathfinder dice, they are all the same and they all work.\nA set of such dice contains 7 special dice: a 4-sided die, a 6-sided die, an 8-sided die, two 10-sided dice, a 12-sided die and a 20-sided die. Only one such set will suffice for playing Questguard to its full extent, though the more dice you have, the merrier!\nEach of these dice contains one number on each face: the 4-sided die goes from 1 to 4, the 6-sided die (normal die) goes from 1 to 6, and so on.\nWherever you live, you can buy a set of roleplaying dice for less than $10 (as of 2023), usually at a board game shop or a gaming store, or, if you can't find any, you can order them online. If you can't afford that, there are plenty of mobile dice simulators. Just search \"dice\" on your mobile application store and there should be several free applications that mimick dice rolling!\nIf you decide to play online and not at a real table, however, you don't need to buy dice and can just use online dice rolling simulators. There are many platforms for online roleplaying and they all incorporate dice rolling simulators.                \n"

And so on and so forth.\n\nIf you are ever in doubt about what a certain dice notation means, you can ask your other team mates or the Quest Master - one of them will surely know!\n\nQuestguard is a \"d12 system\", unlike Dungeons and Dragons and Pathfinder, which are \"d20 systems\". This simply means that you will use the d12 die for _a lot_ of things in Questguard. The 12-sided die will be your best friend while playing Questguard, so learn which one it is! Frankly, we believe it is also the prettiest die of them all! Just look at that perfect shape... beautiful!\n"

                        "value": "Player Characters can all make one Action on their turn. This can mean attacking, casting a magic Spell, or anything you can think of that uses your hands (usually).\n\nThe most standard way to take your turn is to move once and then attack once (or attack and then move).\nIf you want to do something that uses both hands, that's an Action.\nBut what if you want to do something different with each hand? That's where Half-Actions come in.\n\nHalf-Actions are exactly what they sound like: using only one hand to do something is a Half-Action, and using both hands to do something is an Action.\nEssentially, on your turn, you can make 2 Half-Actions (which is the same as an Action).\nAny Action is just two Half-Actions combined. You want to attack with a 2-Handed Swords? That's 1 Action, AKA 2 Half-Actions. You use both your hands for this, and since one hand means one Half-Action, that's simply the same as one Action.\nThe term \"Action\" is just another word for \"two Half-Actions\".\n\nIf you choose to do so, you can even make a Half-Action with one hand, move 4 meters, then make another Half-Action.\n\nBut it gets better! You don't actually need to keep track of which hand you used already! It doesn't matter you already used your right hand to make a Half-Action.\nOn your turn, you have 2 Half-Actions. Period. They are not tied to one hand or the other in particular. You want to make 2 Half-Actions with the same hand? You are free to do so!\nIf you have a shield and a 1-Handed Sword, yes, you can make 2 attacks with the same hand with the same sword. But don't worry about the numbers; the game is balanced around this.\n\nIn the future, when your character becomes more advanced, some Abilities will give you more Actions per turn! If you have a total of 2 Actions on your turn, that's exactly like having 4 Half-Actions. And you'd be able to make 4 attacks with the same hand and weapon, or one attack with a 2-Handed Weapon and 2 attacks with 1-Handed Weapon. You're free to do whatever you want with your hands!\n\nWhen you attack with a weapon, you roll the weapon's dice and subtract the enemy's Defense.\n\nEvery weapon in the game does a certain amount of Damage and all weapons can be found on the Weapons page.\nEvery weapon also benefits from either your Might or your Dexterity.\nFor example, a Club deals 1d10 Damage and uses the Might Stat. So, whenever you attack with the Club, the Damage done by that attack is 1d8 + your Might. If you are the sneaky, slim Gnome, that means 1d8 - 1, which is not very good.\nThe Whip, however, deals 1d4 + 3 Damage and uses Dexterity. Thus, if you are the sneaky Gnome, the Damage will be 1d4 + 6, which is much better!\n\nYou roll the Damage, and the enemy subtracts the Damage you deal from their Health Points. Your job is to get them to 0 or less Health.\n\nHowever, every character and monster has another number called Defense. Whenever it is attacked, their Defense reduces the amount of Damage they take by that amount.\nFor example, if you attack the Bear and the attack would deal 7 Damage, the Bear does not just lose 7 Health, but instead subtracts its Defense from the attack.\nBears' Defense is 4, so, whevener the Bear is attacked, it reduces all incoming Damage by 4. 7 becomes 3. That's the final amount of Damage the Bear takes.\n\nTo conclude, the final Damage of your attack is: (Weapon Damage) + (your Might or Dexterity).\nIn this particular case with you being the Gnome and the enemy being the Bear, the total Damage is (1d6 + 1) + (3) - (4).\n\nNo matter if you use a 1-Handed Weapon (with Half-Actions) or a 2-Handed Weapon (with Actions), the formula is the same. Even if you use both hands, the formula doesn't change. It's always the same.\n"

You can just say \"Let's take a Long Rest\" and the Quest Master might just say \"Done, 8 hours have passed\".\nTake note that you can not Long Rest while camping in a forest, in a dungeon, wilderness, etc!\n\nDuring the gaming session, you will have to keep track yourself of how many Health Points you have, either on a sheet of paper or in a document. Don't cheat!\nYour total amount of Health is calculated when you create your character; we'll get into that a bit later.\n"

                        "title": "Abilities explained",
                        "value": "An Ability is simply a block of text that either gives you some thing extra (passively) or gives you something else to do with your Actions rather than attacking.\nEvery Race and Class gives you some special Abilities. You will know you have these Abilities if they are written on your character sheet.\nIf you are a Gnome, you have some extra Abilities that Elves don't have.\n\nLet's take a look at exactly what Abilities you start with as a Gnome!\n\nFirst off, you have Inherited Tastes. You can see it's a Passive Ability, meaning you don't need to use it manually; it's always there, in the back of your mind. It's like an extra trait for your character.\nInherited Tastes is very simple. You don't have a sense of taste, but your eyes perceive colors sharper than most. Doesn't sound like much, but it is an Ability!\n\nThen, let's look at Lucky Presence. This one is an Ability that you can actually use!\nAfter someone else makes a Check, you can say \"I use Lucky Presence\" and they must roll the check again. Presumably, you would use this on your allies when they fail a Check, or on your enemies when they succeed a Check you would've liked them to fail.\nThere are 2 interesting things about this Ability: the first one is that it's a \"Reaction\". Reaction is another type of Action that you can only do on others' turns. You can't do just anything with Reactions. Every Reaction is usually an Ability that has a specific time when you can use it. In this case, you must use Lucky Presence when someone makes a Check.\nThe second thing to look at is the hourglass icon near which it says \"Long Rest\". This is called a Cooldown and it tells you how long you have to wait before you can use this Ability again after you use it once. If it has a Cooldown of Long Rest, that means you can use it once, and then you must finish a Long Rest before you can use it again.\n\nThat's all the Abilities Gnomes start with! Let's take a look at another Ability now, to see another example. We'll look at the Spell called Bonfire.\nBonfire is a magical Spell, and it is only available to spell casters, like Mages and Shamans. When you cast this, you choose 1-cubic-meter area where a bonfire is conjured, and it deals Damage! The Aability text itself is self explanatory and straight-forward.\nBonfire takes 1 Action to do. So, on your turn, you'd have to choose between attacking and casting Bonfire. Reminder that 1 Action is the same as 2 Half-Actions. So if you cast Bonfire, you can not do anything else with your hands this turn! And if you use one hand for a Half-Action, you can't cast Bonfire; because you are left with a Half-Action, and Bonfire takes 1 whole Action.\nThe last thing to notice about Bonfire is the arrow-and-target icon where it says \"6 meters\". This simply means the spell Bonfire has a maximum range of 6 meters. The space you choose to cast Bonfire on must be within 6 meters of you (and you must be able to see the location, of course).\n\nOne quick way to differentiate Passive from Active Abilities is that Active Abilities have a square icon, while Passive Abilities have a round icon!\n\nLet's look into an Ability that's a little more _Advanced_, Healing Surge.\nThe text is very short and straight-forward - you restore 2d6 Health to a Unit. \nThe \"Half-Action\" and \"5 meters\" tags should also be self explanatory for you by now.\nThe \"1 Mana\" text refers to the cost of this Ability. The next section will explain Spellcasting.\n"

As written on the Mage rules page, Mages start with 3 Mana Points (and get 1 more total Mana every Level). Every Adventure, the Mage can choose to spend these points on casting Spells.\nEach Spell specifies if and how many Mana Points it costs to cast. If you decide to cast Healing Surge, you must expend one Mana Point and then you are left with 2 Mana Points. It doesn't specify that Healing Surge has a Cooldown, so you can do it even twice per turn (since it takes a Half-Action) as long as you have enough Mana Points. If you don't have enough Mana Points to cast a Spell, you simply can't.\n\nWhen building your character, you will have to choose a number of Basic Abilities from the ones available to your class (e.g. Ability Schools, like Elemental, Divine, Warfare, etc) - you can't have them all, there are dozens in the game! You'll pick a few Spells to have at hand. Mages, for example, start out with 4 + your Intelligence Basic Abilities. So, if your Intelligence is 3, you must pick 7 Abilities (total) from the Elemental and/or Arcane Lists. These will be all the Basic Spells you will be able to use until you finish the current Adventure.\nYou pick these Abilities aside from your Class Abilities (e.g. Magic Mastery does not count among the 7).\nCheck our your Class's available Ability Lists by going to your Class's page, at Spell Casting, under Basic Ability Lists. All Basic Abilities are on the Abilities page.\nThis is explained in further detail later on (see Basic Ability Lists).\n\nYou can keep track of your Mana Points on a sheet of paper, with marbles, dice, etc. It is your job to keep track of your Mana Points.
