    "Character Creation": {
        "Welcome To Character Creation!": "In a tabletop roleplaying game like Call of Heroes, a Game Master player creates a story, and hero players play as characters inside that story! If you want to be a hero inside another Game Master's adventure, you need to create your hero, called a Character!\nBefore you even create a Character, you should talk to the GM about what kind of character fits inside their story.\n",
        "What Makes A Character?": "Every character is a combination of a Race, a Class and, of course, a personality, look and backstory. These all should be taken into consideration when creating your character in relation to the story you're taking part in.\nThis section will go over the (now written) social rules when playing the game with a group of people.\nFor a GM's story, you will create your character to your likings; however, you should try to be aware of the social etiquette, explained in the following points.\n",
        "How Do I Come Up With A Character Idea?": "What sounds cool\nRace/class/background for inspiration\nIf you're just starting out, you should first think about what Class you want to play from a coolness standpoint.\nJust pick what sounds the coolest to you!\nIn the current version of the game, the official classes are the following.\nCleric - a religious spellcaster who does not shy away from combat, either (e.g. Anduin, Lady Mellisandre, Moses, Faust from Shaman King)\nDruid - a man of the wilderness who can transform into animals (e.g. Radaghast the Brown, Malfurion, Poison Ivy)\nHunter - a ranger or slayer of monsters, sometimes fighting alongside a trusty animal companion (e.g. Legolas, Geralt from the Witcher)\nMage - a heavy user of magic, generally more frail than most, but possessing vast knowledge and powerful spells (e.g. Merlin, Gandalf, Lina)\nPaladin - an honorable knight who uses both physical prowess and faith-based magic (e.g. Garen from League of Legends, Uther and Arthas, Hollow Knight)\nRogue - a sneaky thief, asassin or ninja, great at isolating and taking out enemies (Ezio or Altair, Garrett from Thief, Corov,  \nShaman - a primal caster, using the powers of spirit, mind and body in communion (Thrall)\nWarlock - TODO\nWarrior - TODO Conan, Ser Jorah\n"
    },
    "Social Etiquette": {
        "Fitting In - Overall Character": "When you play in a GM's story, it's important to consider social etiquette and respect the rules of the story.\nAlthough some points might seem obvious, always keep the following questions in mind and try to respect the social norms of the game you take part in.\n",
        "1. Does My Character Personality Fit?": "You don't want to create a Sci-Fi space marine for a story like Lord of the Rings. That would be silly and break the immersion for other players, and make the story less believable.\nDoes your GM run a dark, gritty, fantasy story? Maybe a witch hunter-type character would do fine, or a dark sorcerer of some sort. Is it a very light-hearted high fantasy experience, with lots of color and dragons everywhere? Maybe something magical would do! Is the story more realistic, with less magic? Perhaps a human warrior would be the best.\n\nDo talk to your team mates about what type of character they want to create.\nRemember that tabletop roleplaying games usually put emphasis on immersion, meaning that players like to submerge themselves in the story and fantasy of the made-up world, and play it as if they live it!\nIf you want to create a funny or joke character, make sure everyone is on-board with that. Don't show up at the game with a comedic, unserious character if everyone is taking it seriously.\n\nLastly in this section, make sure your character wants to work with a team to achieve a goal. Lone wolf characters sound cool, but in practice, the best characters are the one who want to work as a team! You and your fellow players are a team! Always remember that!\n",
        "2. Do My Character Capabilities Fit?": "Another thing to consider is what kind of gameplay will be the most prevalent. Some GM's run stories with a lot of fighting, while some run stories with more talking (roleplaying), exploring, etc. Maybe your GM's story is a murder mystery, or the exploration of an abandoned castle.\nThe number 1. rule is to always ask the GM \"would my character fit your story?\".\n\nYou don't want to show up with a brutish barbarian in a game about politics and talking your way out of situations. Similarly, you don't want to show up with a character with no combat prowess in a game about slaying hordes of monsters in dungeons.\n\nTalk to your GM.\n",
        "3. Does My Character Story Fit?": "Similar to the first point, you must consider your character's backstory when joining a GM's story.\nWhen you create your character, you will probably want to give it a made-up history: a war veteran who lost their son in a battle, or a mage who gave up studies to become a warrior.\n\nMake sure this fits the story setting. If your character was born in King's Landing from Game of Thrones but the story takes place in Middle Earth, you should rethink your backstory.\nA good rule of thumb is to leave certain aspects of your character's backstory up to interpretation by the GM. That brings about more story possibilities and gives the GM a chance to surprise you with some interesting findings about your character's past!\n\nFinally, but very importantly, does your backstory even matter? Your GM might run a game where all players wake up and have amnesia. Or they might give you a specific backstory. In that case, you should understand your backstory might not matter all that much, if at all. Always ask the GM!\n",
        "4. Am I Respecting The Custom Rules?": "Generally, characters start being Level 1 adventurers and progress in power up to Level 10 characters. However, the GM might have you start at another level, like Level 2 or Level 5.\n\nAside from that, the GM might impose custom rules for character creation, like not allowing certain Races or Classes in the game. If you have a dream character, make sure your choices are allowed in the GM's story.\n"

    "Creating The Actual Character Part 1": {
        "Getting Started": "Assuming you already decided on your Race and Class, let's get started on the numbers!\n",
        "Character Sheet": "Each Character is represented on a sheet of paper (or digitally) on a document called the Character Sheet.\nThe Character Sheet is a document that holds all the important stats and data about your character.\nThe easiest way to make a Character Sheet is to download this form-fillable PDF. It contains modifyable text forms for everything your character needs that's gameplay-related!\nAlthough, note that as of 2022, if you open this PDF in the browser, you might not be able to re-save it completed! To be sure, use an application like Adobe PDF Reader or WPS to open it, modify it and save it. Always remember to save it again!\n\nAlternatively, feel free to use a regular sheet of paper, an Excel spreadsheet, or whatever you consider a good option.\nIf you play in a physical location at a table, it might be a good idea to print the Character Sheet on paper for ease of use and modification.\nIn the following sections, we will go over each statistic necessary for your Character.\n",
        "Name, Class and Race": "These fields are self-explanatory. Complete the Name with your character's full name and the Player Name with your real life name (or nickname, or whatever your friends know you as).",
        "The 5 Stats": "Every Call of Heroes character's capabilities are represented by 5 statistics (Stats): Might (strength and resistance), Dexterity (agility and reflexes), Wisdom (the 5 senses, intuition and willpower), Intelligence (knowledge and magic) and Charisma (people skills).\nWhen you create your character, take the following numbers and assign each of them to a Stat.\n"
    },
    "The Stats": [
        -1,
        0,
        1,
        2,
        3
    ],
    "Creating The Actual Character Part 2": {
        "Stats Explained": "Each Character must have a somewhat balanced stat distribution - everyone is really good at something and realy bad at something else. Your Stat with -1 will be what you are bad at.\n\nIn Call of Heroes, there is no rolling for stats (like in other games). These numbers represent directly your Stat. If you make a Dexterity Check, you roll 1d12 and add your Dexterity to it. If your Dexterity is 3, then you roll 1d12 and add 3.\n\nThere are no substats like in other games (e.g. Skills in Dungeons and Dragons, like Acrobatics, Intimidation, or Reflex/Fortitude/Will in Pathfinder). Checks are done directly with the Stat's number (roll a d12 and add the Stat).\n",
        "Race Stat Constraints": "Some Races put a constraint on your Stat distribution. For example, the Orc Race (Race Features > Stat Distribution) says that your Might must be at least 2.\nThat means that your Might must be either 2 or 3 from the numbers -1, 0, 1, 2, and 3. This does NOT mean that if your Might is -1 it becomes 2!\n"
    },
    "Stat Calculations": {
        "Maximum Health": "Race Health + Class Health + Might",
        "Speed": "Defined by your Race",
        "Initiative": "Your Dexterity + Your Charisma",
        "Armor": "Depending on your Class, you can wear Armor of a certain heaviness up to a limit. If your Class permits Medium armor, then you can wear Light and Medium Armor.\nWhen you create your Character, pick any Armor you can wear from the Armors page.\n",
        "Defense": "Your Armor Type you are wearing",
        "Training": "Look at Race Features > Weapons and Other Training to see what you are Trained in.\nEach Race and Class provides you with some Training in Weapons.\nIf you are Trained in a weapon, you can use it properly. Otherwise, you can't add your Stat to the attack's damage (unless it's -1) and the weapon's effect is negated (see Weapon Training).\nSome Races and Classes only give you the Training if your Intelligence is high enough when you create your character.\n",
        "Languages": "All Races speak the Common tongue (for our purposes, English).\nMost Races and some Classes have some extra languages they can speak.\nLike with Training, some Races and Classes require you to have a certain amount of Intelligence to know them.\n"
