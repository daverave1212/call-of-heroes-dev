    "Weapon Training": "If you have Training in a weapon, you can attack with that weapon normally (roll weapon damage and add the Stat the weapon uses, usually Might or Dexterity).\nIf you attack with a weapon you are not Trained in, you can't add the damage from your Stat to the attack and the Weapon's effect is negated.\nNote that you can still subtract your Stat if it's -1.\n\nFor example, let's say you are Trained in the Shortsword (1d6 + 1 damage) and your Dexterity is 3. You attack and roll 4 on the d6, so the Shortsword's damage will be 5 (4 + 1); you add 3 from Dexterity and the final result is 8.\nIf you are not Trained in the Shortsword, and roll 4 on the d6, the Shortsword's damage would be 5 (4 + 1). Since you can't add your Dexterity to the attack, the damage remains 5.\nAs another example, if you have -1 Might and attack with a Pickaxe (2d4 + 5) and you are not Trained in it, your final damage is 2d4 + 4 (-1 from your Might).\n\nRaces, Classes and Backgrounds can give you two types of weapon Training: Training in a specific weapon type or Training in a weapon Category.\nTraining in a weapon Type means you are Trianed that weapon type exactly: Shortswords, Longbows, Rapiers, Shields, Pickaxes, etc.\nTraining in a weapon Category means you are trained in ALL weapon types from that category. The categories are 1-Handed Melee, 2-Handed Melee, 1-Handed Ranged, 2-Handed Ranged, Throwing Weapons and Shields.\n",
    "How To Get Weapon Training": "Most Races and Classes give you free Training in various weapons or weapon types, as well as some backgrounds.\nYou can get Training in any weapon category by getting the Weapon Training Feat (see Feats).\nFinally, you can get Training in any weapon by spending one Inspiration Point (see Inspiration).\n",
    "Thrown Weapons": "Thrown Weapons is a Weapon Category in itself.\nSome weapons are optionally Thrown. If you are Trained in that Weapon Type specifically (e.g. Daggers), you are Trained both in normal attacks with it and in throwing it.\nIf you are Trained in 1-Handed Weapons but not Trained in Thrown Weapons specifically, you can make normal melee attacks with the weapon, but you are not Trained in throwing it (so, when throwing it, you do not add the Stat).\n",
    "Shield Training": "If you wear a Shield and you are not Trained in Shields, you do not benfit from the shield's extra Defense.\n",
    "Inspiration Training": "You can choose to spend 1 Inspiration Point to unlock Training in any Weapon Type (Shortswords, Longbows, Rapiers, Shields, etc).\nInspiration Points are awarded by the Game Master for cool ideas, outstanding roleplaying or strategies or, honestly, whatever the Game Master wants to give Inspiration Points for.\nSee the Inspiration page for more information.\n",
    "Inspiration Points": "In Call of Heroes, the Game Master can give a player an Inspiration Point for a cool idea, outstanding roleplaying or strategies or, honestly, whatever the Game Master wants to give Inspiration Points for.\nGenerally, you can earn an Inspiration Point for impressing the Game Master or contributing well to the game. It's up to each Game Master to decide what impresses them and when to award an Inspiration Point.\nInspiration Points are awarded individually. We recommend that the Game Master awards 1 to 2 Inspiration Points (total, not per player) every session.\n",
    "What Can I Do With Inspiration?": "Inspiration Points can be spent to improve your character or influence the tide of roleplaying.\nYou can spend one Inspiration Point to gain Training in any one Weapon Type (Shortswords, Rapiers, Shields, etc) or gain one Proficiency Ability from any Background in the Backgrounds list.\nYou can spend an Inspiration Point to also increase your Maximum Health by 1.\nFinally, you can also spend one Inspiration Point to nudge a situation slightly in your favor or influence the outcome of a roleplaying situation. This is up to your creativity. For example, if the GM says you can't find a Blacksmith in a town, you could say \"I want to use my Inspiration to actually find a Blacksmith\". Or, for another example, if you fall down a ravine, you could say \"I want to use my Inspiration to have remembered to tie a rope to myself before crossing this ravine\". So, in theory, you could alter the past and the present. Use your creativity!\nHowever, remember that the GM can refuse to allow you to use Inspiration in a way. Inspiration is meant to nudge the outcomes slightly, not alter whole timelines or create large-scale modifications to the present. Always ask the GM if you are allowed to use Inspiration this way.\n",
    "Movement": "dsds\n- pusshing does not count towards ...\n",
    "Initiative": "Initiative determines the order in which Units take their turns in combat.\n\nA Player Character's Initiative Bonus is equal to (their Dexterity + their Charisma).\n\nTo determine turn order, at the start of a combat all Players roll 1d12 and add their Initiative Bonus to it.\nMonster units don't roll,but instead have a fixed Initiative (e.g. 10, 8, 14, etc, depending on the monster).\nUnits take their turns from the highest Initiative (rolled) to the lowest. The highest result goes first, the lowest goes last.\n\nIf there's a tie between a Player Unit and an enemy, the Player Unit goes before the monster (the Player Unit takes their turn first, and then the monster).\nIf there's a tie between two Player Units, either can go before (they decide as a group).\nIf there's a tie between two or more enemies, the GM decides which one goes before.\n",
    "Opportunity Attacks": "When a Unit A exits the melee attack range of another Unit B, Unit B can make one melee weapon attack on Unit A using its Reaction. This is called an Opportunity Attack.\nThe attack can be either with a 2-Handed Weapon or a 1-Handed Weapon.\n\nBeing pushed by an Ability out of the melee attack range of a Unit does NOT give that Unit an Opportunity Attack.\n\nYou _can_ push yourself with an Ability out of the melee attack range like this.\n",
    "Resistance and Weakness": "Resistance to a certain damage type means you only take 50% of that damage (of the final damage you take; e.g. after subtracting Defense).\nWeakness to a certain damage type means you take 150% of that damage (of the final damage you take; e.g. after subtracting Defense).\n",
    "Throwing Weapons": "Some weapons state that they are \"Optionally Thrown\".\nThat means you can throw the weapon and attack with it at range, with the same Stat and damage (unless stated othwerise).\nThe range of all Thrown weapons is 5 meters.\n\nWhen it comes to Training, Thrown Weapons is a Weapon Category in itself.\nSome weapons are optionally Thrown. If you are Trained in that Weapon Type specifically (e.g. Daggers), you are Trained both in normal attacks with it and in throwing it.\nIf you are Trained in 1-Handed Weapons but not Trained in Thrown Weapons specifically, you can make normal melee attacks with the weapon, but you are not Trained in throwing it (so, when throwing it, you do not add the Stat).\nSee the Training rules for more information on how Training works.\n",
    "Actions": "Player Characters can all make one Action on their turn. This can mean attacking, casting a magic Spell, or anything you can think of that uses both your hands (usually).\nAn Action is typically associated with doing something with both hands.\nYou can split an Action into two Half-Actions.\n\nThe term \"Action\" is just another word for \"two Half-Actions\".\n\nYou can't move, take actions (even if something takes 0 Actions) and then move again. There are, however, Abilities that circumvent this.\n",
    "Half-Actions": "Half-Actions are exactly what they sound like: using only one hand to do something is a Half-Action, and using both hands to do something is an Action.\nEssentially, on your turn, you can make 2 Half-Actions (which is the same as an Action).\nAny Action is just two Half-Actions combined. The term \"Action\" is just another word for \"two Half-Actions\".\n\nYou want to attack with a 2-Handed Swords? That's 1 Action, AKA 2 Half-Actions. You use both your hands for this, and since one hand means one Half-Action, that's simply the same as one Action.\n\nIf you choose to do so, you can even make a Half-Action with one hand, move 4 meters, then make another Half-Action.\n\nYou don't actually need to keep track of which hand you used already! It doesn't matter you already used your right hand to make a Half-Action.\nHalf-Actions are not tied to one hand or the other in particular.\n\nYou CAN make 2 attacks with the same hand using 2 Half-Actions.\nIf you have a shield and a 1-Handed Sword, yes, you can make 2 attacks with the same hand with the same sword. The game's weapons and numbers are balanced around this.\n\nWhen your character becomes more advanced, some Abilities will give you more Actions per turn! If you have a total of 2 Actions on your turn, that's exactly like having 4 Half-Actions. And you'd be able to make 4 attacks with the same hand and weapon, or one attack with a 2-Handed Weapon and 2 attacks with 1-Handed Weapon (e.g. Action Surge).\n",
    "Line of Sight": "If a Unit A can see a Unit B, then Unit A has Line of Sight to Unit B.\nIf Unit A can see even a little bit of the body of Unit B, then Unit A still has Line of Sight to Unit B (but attacks usually gain the Hard Cover pentalty if you can barely see the target).\n\nIf playing on a grid, there is Line of Sight from square A to square B if you can draw a line from any corner of square A to any corner of square B without any other Unit or Obstacle crossing the line.\nHowever, other Units' or obstacles' squares can _intersect_ the line you were drawing if it's merely tangential, and does not pass from one side of the line to the other.\nSee the example below.\n\nWithout magical means, Line of Sight is always 2-way. If Unit A has LoS to Unit B, then Unit B also has LoS to Unit A (assuming they look at one another).\n",
    "Cooldown": "Some Abilities have a Cooldown.\nCooldown refers to the time you must wait to use the Ability again.\nAn Ability's Cooldown is represented by the _white hourglass_ icon. If an Ability has no such icon, then it has no Cooldown and can be used as often as you like.\nA Cooldown of \"Long Rest\" means you can use the Ability ONCE, and then can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.\nA Cooldown mentioning time (e.g. 1 hour, 1 day, etc) always refers to in-game time, not real-life time. 1 day in game can pass instantly, if the Game Master says \"one day passes\", for example. Like in a book, movie or video game, time in-game passes from scene to scene, according to the adventure story.\n",
    "Triggering Abilities": "Some Abilities give you free uses of other Abilities. For example, Clerics get to cast Awe for free, even if it's on a Cooldown.\nWhen an Ability tells you that you can \"freely cast X ignoring its Cooldown/Cost\", you can cast that Ability in that moment, whether it's on Cooldown or not.\nIf it's not on Cooldown, the Ability does NOT go on Cooldown if you trigger a free cast like this.\nIf it's on Cooldown, the Ability remains on Cooldown.\n",
    "Knowing and Learning Spells": "All Classes get access to some generic Spells. All these Spells are in Spell Lists. Some Classes get access to some generic Spells, and some to other generic Spells, depending on categories (e.g. Mages get access to all Arcane and Elemental Spells, but no access to Nature Spells).\nAll Classes can pick a few of these Spells to Learn for adventuring.\nTo be able to cast as Spell (AKA to have that Spell) you need to Learn it on a Long Rest. That becomes a Known Spell (you Know that Spell).\nOnce you Learn a Spell, you Know it. When you see the term \"Known Spell\", it always refers to a generic Spell from the Spell Lists.\n\nDifferent Classes have different simple rules for knowing Spells.\nMages, for example, can know a number of Spells of any kind from the ones that are available to them (e.g. any from the Elemental, Arcane, etc, but none from Nature, Divine, etc).\nOnce Known, these Spells can be cast as many times as the Cooldown and Cost allows (e.g. as long as you have enough Mana to cast it; explained later).\nCheck out Mana-based Spellcasting to see how this works.\n\nPaladins, for example, have no Mana, but instead have some limits on how many Spells they can know.\nCheck out Insight-based Spellcasting to see how this works.\n",
    "Mana-based Spellcasting": "Clerics, Mages, Rogues, Warlocks and Warriors use a system of points called Mana Points.\nYou have a number of Mana Points that you can spend to cast some Spells, and you regain all Mana Points back when you finish a Long Rest (7 in-game days of non-adventuring).\n\nThe amount of Mana a Spell costs to cast is represented by the _blue flame_ icon and the number near it.\n\nFor a clear example, let's take a look at the Mage Class. As written on the Mage rules page, Mages start with 3 Mana Points (and get 1 more total Mana every Level). Between Long Rests, the Mage can choose to spend these points on casting Spells.\nEach Spell specifies if and how many Mana Points it costs to cast. If you decide to cast Healing Surge, you must expend one Mana Point and then you are left with 2 Mana Points. It doesn't specify that Healing Surge has a Cooldown, so you can do it even twice per turn (since it takes a Half-Action) as long as you have enough Mana Points. If you don't have enough Mana Points to cast a Spell, you simply can't.\n\nWhen building your character, you will have to choose a number of Spells from the ones avaialble to your class - you can't have them all, there are dozens in the game! You'll pick a few Spells to have at hand. Mages, for example, start out with 4 + your Intelligence Spells. So, if your Intelligence is 3, you must pick 7 out of all the Spells Mages can choose from. These will be all the Spells you will be able to Cast until you finish your next Long Rest (7 in-game days of non-adventuring).\nThis is explained in further detail later on (see Spell Lists).\n\nYou can keep track of your Mana Points on a sheet of paper, with marbles, dice, etc. It is your job to keep track of your Mana Points. Don't cheat!\n",
    "Insight-based Spellcasting": "Druids, Hunters, Paladins and Shamans don't have Mana, but instead have Insight.\n\nWhen you pick your spells to know (Known Spells), the total Insight required by your Known Spells can't exceed your Insight.\nThe amount of Insight a Spell takes is represented by the _teal eye_ icon and the number near it.\n\nInsight Spells don't cost Mana, but generally have a Cooldown (depends on each Spell).\n\nYou can keep track of your Cooldowns on a sheet of paper or with printed Spell cards.\n",
    "Main Stat": "The Main Stat is what it sounds like: it is the primary Stat you will use for most things when using Abilities.\nSome Abilities will say you have to add your Main Stat to its damage.\n\nMost Classes allow you to pick which Stat you want your Main Stat to be, usually from Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma.\n",
    "Enemy Check Grade": "This is equal to your Main Stat + 6.\nNot only players roll Checks, but also enemies. Some Abilities force enemies to roll a Check to avoid it.\nWhen you make an enemy roll a Check, the Check must be equal or higher than your Enemy Check Grade. If they do, they succeed; otherwise, they fail. An Ability tells you explicitly what happens on a success or failure.\n",
    "Spell Lists": "Aside from the Abilities you get from your Race and Class, there are also some Spell Lists you have access to.\nClasses have access to different Spell Lists and can have a number of Spells chosen from those Spells.\n\nA Spell List is simply a list of Spells in that category (see the Abilities page). The text for every Ability is also in that list. Take a look at this page to familiarize yourself with them.\nThere are a few Spell Lists in the game, and a Spell List usually refers to a category of Spells: Maneuvers, Elemental, Arcane, Nature, Conjuration, Mysticism, Eldritch and Divine.\n\nClerics, for example, can have 4 + their Intelligence Spells from these lists.\nClerics have access to the Mysticism, Conjuration and Divine Spell Lists.\nThis means that if you are a Cleric (and let's say your Intelligence is 2), you can pick 6 Spells from _any_ of those 3 Spell Lists and have them at a ready. Some of those Spells will cost Mana to use, some not.\n",
    "Known Spells (Mana-based)": "If your class is Mana-based, then your Known Spells are very straightforward.\nYou can have that many known Spells.\nYou look at the Spell Lists your class has access to (e.g. Clerics have access to the Mysticism, Conjuration and Divine Spell Lists).\nFrom all those Spells, you pick a number of them and you have them at a ready. Some of those Spells will cost Mana to use, some not.\n\nIf a Spell displays a blue flame icon and a number, then it costs that much Mana to cast it.\n\nThese spells represent what your Character has prepared for adventuring. They function exactly like Abilities you have. On Long Rests, you can change what Spells from these Spell Lists your Character knows.\n",
    "Known Spells (Insight-based)": "If your class is Insight-based, you can know a number of Spells from your Spell Lists.\nWhen Learning your Spells from Spell Lists, the total amount of Insight of your Known Spells must not exceed your character's Insight.\nYou can think of Insight as \"available memory\". Some Spells occupy \"memory\" (Insight).\n\nIf you don't have enough Insight left to learn (Know) a Spell, you can't learn it.\nIf a Spell displays a _teal eye_ icon and a number, then it takes up that much Insight to _know_ it. Most Insight Spells have a Long Rest Cooldown.\n",
    "Relearning Spells": "All Classes can unlearn and re-learn their Spells from Spell Lists when finishing a Long Rest.\nTalents can also be swapped on Long Rests.\n",
    "Dice calculations": "To denote multiple dice of the same type rolled at the same time, you will see a number in front of the \"d\", like \"2d4\" or \"5d6\". That simply means \"two 4-sided dice\" or \"five 6-sided dice\". If something tells you to roll \"5d6\", roll five 6-sided dice all at the same time, and sum up the result!\nSometimes, you will also need to roll multiple dice of multiple types, like \"2d8 + 3d12\". That means you must roll two 8-sided dice and three 12-sided dice all at the same time and sum up the result.\nYou might also see other \"modifiers\" to dice rolls, such as \"+ 3\" or \"- 1\". That simply means you add 3 to the total number, or subtract 1 from the total number. So, such an example might be \"2d6 + 2\" or \"2d4 + 3d10 - 5\". Roll all those dice and add or subtract the number mentioned.\nIn other cases, you will see other modifiers like \"+ your Might\" or \"+ your Dexterity\". These are usually self explanatory - they refer to adding your character's Might or your character's Dexterity to the final number. Such an example might be \"2d6 + your Might\". In this case, you roll 2d6 and add your character's Might to the final result.\n",
    "Leveling Up": "In Call of Heroes, there are 10 Player Character Levels (from 1 to 10). Most characters start as Level 1 characters and progress level by level towards Level 10.\nEach Level, a character gains some extra Health (based on Class) and extra resources, like maximum Mana or Insight, extra available Spells, Feats, Stats, etc.\nEvery 2 Levels, characters also gain a Talent from their Class - these are usually strong Abilities that define how you play your character.\n\nThere are 2 ways in which PC's can level up: either through gaining Experience from killing monsters, completing tasks and puzzles, roleplaying, etc _or_ by milestones set by the Game Master. It is up to each GM to use a system that fits their own adventure\n\nThe milestone system is the recommended system for most adventures, as it's easier to work with and more thematic.\nIf you are using the milestone system, the Game Master will simply decide that all players level up when the GM thinks the time is right. This is generally after a boss fight or after an important story event.\nIn the milestone system, there are no Experience Points.\n\nLeveling up can't happen during combat, but it is delayed to after combat.\nUpon Leveling Up, the Player Characters benefit instantly from a Long Rest (e.g. heal to full Health, regain Mana, reset Cooldowns, etc).\nAs a variant rule, the Game Master can decide to not give the players a free Long Rest when Leveling up.\n",
    "The Experience System": "In the Experience system, a Player needs an amount of Experience Points to Level Up. Each Player has a separate track of Experience Points, but it is recommended that Game Masters award Experience Points equally, so that all players Level Up at the same time.\nOnce a player Levels Up their character, their Experience Points are spent, but they keep extra Experience they didn't spend. For example, if a Player has 500 Experience Points and they need 450 to Level Up, they Level Up and they keep 50 Experience. After that, they need to \"fill up the Experience meter\" again to Level Up.\n\nThe amount of Experience Points required to Level Up to the next level is equal to (next level) * 100. To Level Up from Level 1 to Level 2, you need 200 Experience Points. Then, to Level up from Level 2 to Level 3, you need 300 more Experience Points. And so on.\n\nNote: If you're coming from other RPG's, note that how much Experience you need to get from a Level to another does NOT refer to ALL the Experience your character has amassed so far. From Level 1 to 2, you need 200 Experience. And from Level 2 to 3 you need 300 _more_ Experience. The total amount of Experience needed for you to be Level 3 is 500. So, no, you obviously don't need just 100 Experience to Level up every time.\n",
    "Distributing Experience": "When the players as a group defeat an enemy that awards Experience, distribute that Experience evenly among all players who took part.\nIf a monster was worth 200 Experience and there are 4 party members, then each party member gets 50 Experience. Monsters don't have levels in CoH, but rather each monster awards experience.\n\nThe Game Master will usually announce how much Experience an encounter was worth. The GM can also award Experience for other tasks, such as getting out of a situation, solving puzzles, completing a part of the storyline, etc.\n",
    "Long Resting": "dsds\nInterrupting long rest..\n"
