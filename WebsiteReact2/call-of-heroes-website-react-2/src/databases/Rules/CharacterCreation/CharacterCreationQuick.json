    "Character Creation": {
        "Intro": "This section explains how to quickly create your character and fill your character sheet.\nEvery subsection of character creation will explain the related rules.\n",
        "Character Sheet": "You can download the form-fillable PDF version of the character sheet at Database, Other, Character Sheet (PDF).\n",
        "What Makes A Character": "Every character is a combination of a Race, a Class.\nYou can find all the available Races under Database, Races and all Classes under Database, Classes.\nThink of a Race and Class combination that you would like to play. You can browse them to get an idea for what they are, or you can decide based on what sounds cool to you.\nThere is no \"background\", like in other games.\n"
    },
    "Filling the Character Sheet": {
        "Intro": "Character creation can be done as follows:\nFirst, fill in your stats.\nSecond, fill in all the data from your Race.\nThird, fill in all the data from your Class.\n",
        "Stats": "Every Questguard character's capabilities are represented by 5 Stats: Might (strength and resistance), Dexterity (agility and reflexes), Sense (the 5 senses, intuition and willpower), Intelligence (knowledge and magic) and Charisma (people skills).\nWhen you create your character, take the following numbers and assign each of them to a Stat: -1, 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\n{Stats}\n",
        "Race Stats": "Every Race imposes some restrictions to how you can put in your Stats. For example, if you're an Elf, you need at least 1 Dexterity and 1 Intelligence.\n",
        "Stat Notes": "Unlike in other games, there is no distinction between a Stat and a Stat Modifier."
    },
    "Race Fill-Ins": {
        "Race Features": "On the Race Page, scroll to Race Features. There you will see a few things in boxes. We will go through each of these brown boxes, one by one, and put them on your character sheet.\n\n{Max Health}\n",
        "Health Regen": "This is the small box near your Health, and it's given by your Race, plus your Level. Inbetween combat encounters, you automatically heal for an amount equal to your Health Regen.\n\n{Speed}\n",
        "Languages": "You always speak Common. You might also speak other languages based on what your Race gives you. If it says you speak a number of languages equal to your Intelligence, this is at least 0 (e.g. you can't go negative and forget languages).\nPut these in the Languages box, the 4th box of the 4 small boxes under Stats.\n"
    },
    "Race Abilities": {
        "Abilities Explained": "All Feats, Spells, special powers, etc in this game are called Abilities. When you see a box with a nice little icon, a name, description, etc, that's an Ability.\nSome Abilities cost an Action or a Half-Action. Some cost 0 Actions, meaning you don't spend any actions on your turn to use them (there is no such thing as a Bonus Action).\nSome Abilities are Passive, meaning they're always there and you don't need to specify you use them - they simply are.\n",
        "Keeping Track of Your Abilities": "You can keep track of what Abilities you have (e.g. their names) in the Description section of the Character Sheet, on the right.\nThere is also a page called Ability Sheet Maker (under Learn, Resources for Learning). You can use that app to add your Abilities, then click on Generate to see all your Abilities in a single place. You can take a screenshot of these or right click and save the images as PNG's. The list you made should remain saved on your browser, but this is not guaranteed to work.\n",
        "Race Abilities": "Every Race gives you some Abilities, listed under Abilities. You have all of them. Take note of them.\nSome Races like Dragonsworn allow you to pick an extra Ability from their Ability Choices.\n",
        "Race Choice": "Every Race gets to pick one starting Ability to customize their character better.\n",
        "That's All": "That's all for the Race! Now, let's move to the Class."
    },
    "Class Fill-Ins": {
        "Initiative Explained": "This refers to the order in combat. When combat starts, you roll Initiative (1d12 + Initiative) and, the higher you roll, the sooner you act in combat.\n\n{Initiative}\n",
        "Weapon Training": "Every Class gives you Training in one or more weapon categories.\nThere are 5 weapon categories, all very simple: 1-Handed Melee, 2-Handed Melee, 1-Handed Ranged, 2-Handed Ranged and Shields.\nThink of what kind of weapons your character would use and put the Training in weapons you have in Training; it's one of the small 4 boxes under Stats.\nYou will pick your actual weapon later. But, for reference, you can take a look at the Weapons under Database, Gear and Items, Weapons.\nNote that weapon attacks use either Might or Dexterity (usually). If you want more of a spell-casting playstyle, weapons might not matter as much.\n",
        "Armors": "When you create your character, you can pick one armor that your character is wearing (as long as you can afford it).\nFor now, simply choose an armor type that sounds good and affordable, and you can account for whether you can afford it later.\nYou can find the armor types under Database, Gear and Items and {Armors}.\n",
        "Defense Explained": "The Defense of most characters is 0 (what you roll is what you get on the Damage dice).\nHowever, if you have Defense, you subtract Defense from any Damage you take.\nFor example, if you have 2 Defense and you would take 10 Damage, you will only take 8.\n",
        "Skills (Being Skilled)": "In Questguard, there isn't a list of set Checks with bonuses written directly on your Character Sheet.\nInstead, there are Skills - non-combat activities your character is generally good at. A Skill is just an Ability that allows you to add your Character's Level to non-combat Checks (with a d12) in certain scenarios. Like Skilled in Acrobatics (bonus to all Checks that can be interpreted as \"acrobatics\") or Skilled in Occultism (bonus to all Checks about knowing \"occult\" or dark information). We call this being Skilled in a type of activity.\n\nA Skill (being Skilled) in an activity always gives you a bonus equal to your Character's Level when performing that activity. So, if you want to jump from a balcony to another and you have Skilled in Acrobatics, you make a Dexterity Check and add your Level to that Check. The final number is your result for the Check.\n\nHowever, Skills are often up to interpretation. For example, the Quest Master might ask you for a general Sense Check to see if you can spot the spy, and it is up to you to mention you are Skilled in something that would help you. Try to come up with a reason why your Skill can be applied in this situation!\n\nEvery Class gives you certain Skills and lets you also pick a number of them, depending on your Intelligence.\nYou can find a list of Skills under Database, {Proficiencies}, All. If you want to be Skilled in something and it's not there, you're free to make it up, but it must be approved by the Quest Master.\n"

    "Spell Casting": {
        "Mana Explained": "Mana is a resource you will use to use some Abilities. Some Abilities cost Mana to use. If so, you simply expend that many Mana points and you use the Ability. If you don't have enough Mana points as indicated by an Ability, you can't use that Ability.\nYour Mana points only replenish inbetween Adventures, so use them wisely.\n\nThe cost of an Ability is indicated by a blue flame icon.\n\nAll Classes use Mana, even non-spellcasters.\n",
        "Mana": "Tick the star-circles on the bottom-right side of the character sheet to signify your Max Mana.",
        "Spell Grade Explained": "This is the number a monster will have to roll above when making a Check against you (also called Spell DC in other games). Your Class will dictate what your Spell Grade is, but it will usually be 6 + A Certain Stat.\n",
        "Known Basic Abilities": "For each Adventure, you can prepare a number of Basic Abilities.\nA Basic Ability is just an Ability from the Basic Ability Lists. Every Class has access to different Ability Lists.\n\nThe number of Basic Abilities your character knows is listed here, in the Class page.\n\nFeel free to browse all the Abilities (Database, Abilities, All) and choose that number of Abilities from there that your character has (from the Ability Lists your Class has access to). You can change these inbetween Adventures.\n"

        "Starting Abilities": "You get all of these Abilities.\nTake note of them on your Character Sheet (e.g. in Description).\nIf you are Level 1, then skip the following subsections.\n",
        "Specialization (Level 2)": "At Level 2, you choose your Class Specialization.\nYou have all Abilities listed under \"You Start With...\".\nSome Class Specializations will let you choose between some Abilities.\n",
        "Talents (Level 3+)": "From Level 3, every 2 Levels (3, 5, 7, 9), you gain a Talent from your Class Specialization.\nEvery 2 Levels, you have to pick exactly one from the options at exactly that Level. For example, at Level 5, you can NOT pick one more Talent from Level 2.\n",
        "Feats": "There exist a set of extra Abilities called Feats (which you can find on the {Feats} page). These usually change how you play your character or give you some extra interesting options, but always have a cost attached (usually in Max Health, Mana, Initiative, etc).\nYou can get as many of these as you can afford.\nFeats are optional, and you're not necessarily missing out if you decide to play without Feats.\n"
