    "Cover (-2)": "If you have Cover from another Unit, you take 2 less Damage from that Unit and have +2 to all Checks against that Unit.\nA Unit has Cover if hiding from another Unit behind a small or medium object or another Unit (that you could logically shoot or attack over/through/around); e.g. being behind a fence, barrel, pillar, tree, etc.\nCover does apply to melee attacks as well.\nTo determine whether a Unit has cover from another Unit, draw a line from each corner of the space to each corner of the other Unit's space. If any of the lines is obstructed by an obstacle, then it has Cover.\n\nCover is not necessarily 2-way. If you have Cover from an enemy, it does not mean the enemy has Cover from you. Apply reason. You shoot an arrow from the tip of your weapon and aim to hit any body part of the enemy. You, as the attacker, can keep the rest of your body safe while only exposing part of yourself when attacking. When in doubt, apply common sense or ask the Game Master.\n\nFor example, if you are hiding behind a rock and another Unit shoots an arrow at you that would normally deal 8 Damage, the arrow now deals 6 Damage. Or, if a Unit makes you roll a Dexterity Check and you have Cover from that Unit, you gain +2 to the roll. Or, if a Unit casts Magic Missiles on you and shoots 3 missiles (1d4 each), and you have Cover from that Unit, each missile will now deal 1d4 - 2 Damage (down to 0).\nTip: If you play on a grid and walls obstruct Line of Sight strictly around the corners of its squares, then a ranged Unit can hide behind the margin of a wall and shoot from there if it has Line of Sight from any of its space's corner to any of the enemy's space's corners. If the line in the Line of Sight merely touches the space of the wall, then it's ok; it does have Line of Sight. If it goes through that space, then it does not have Line of Sight (see the Line of Sight rule for a more detailed explanation).\n\nCertain Abilities ignore Cover.\n\nCover does not stack (e.g. you can't get 2 Covers and take -4 Damage - it's still just one Cover, just -2).\n",
    "Flanked (+1)": "Melee attacks on Flanked Units gain +1.\nIf you are melee-attacking a Unit and there's one of your allies directly behind (1 meter) your target, the attack is Flanking and gains +1.\nNormally, you, your target and the ally behind it are supposed to form a straight line for the attack to count as Flanking, but this works even if your ally behind the target is one space too much to the left or to the right (but still within 1 meter of the target). See the image!\n",
    "Falling (+1)": "If you are falling at least 1 meter onto a target, the first attack gains +1.\nOnly one attack at a time benefits from falling.\n",
    "Stunt (+1)": "If you try to do something cool that's not listed here, the Game Master might award your attack a Stunt bonus.\nThis Stunt bonus can be granted by the Game Master for heroic moves, strange strategies, etc. If you want to do something cool and believe it should gain a Stunt bonus, ask the GM.\n\nStunt bonus is only granted with the approval of the GM.\nUsually, you can't benefit twice from the same Stunt. Only the first time you ever do it gains the Stunt bonus."
