The Shop section lists the category of every item. If an item is not listed there, discuss with your DM the category of that item.\nEach type of item can weigh you down by a number of Weight Amount (points).\nThis does not include your equipped gear, such as armor you are wearing or weapons you are wielding.\nIf your character carries more Weight Amount than it's limit, it becomes encumbered (explained later in this section).\nYour character's Weight Amount limit is equal to 2 + its Fortitude.\nYour character can't physically carry more than double its Weight Amount limit.\n",
    "Categories": "Small items have no individual Weight Amount. But each 10 small items of the same type you are carrying are worth 1 Weight Amount.
