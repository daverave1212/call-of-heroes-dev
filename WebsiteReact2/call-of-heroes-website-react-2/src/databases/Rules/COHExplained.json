    "To talk about": "The world is imaginary (obviously), fantasy (medieval)\nSlay monsters, get treasure\nFind players on discord, facebook, college clubs, gaming stores\nWhat the GM's responsibility is:\n    - GM is not the enemy, they are the narrator and referee\n    - Prepare, managing many things at once\n    - Playing the role of NPC's\n",
    "What is Call of Heroes?": "Call of Heroes is a modern, tabletop roleplaying game (tabletop RPG) in which a Game Master player creates and narrates a story, and other people play as individual character in this story. Clal of Heroes can be seen as a better alternative to Dungeons and Dragons, with more player-friendly (and clearly written) rules, mechanics that area easier to understand, more intriguing options and digitally modern. Described directly, it's cleverly simple, modern and plainly cool! Like the games it draw inspiration from, Call of Heroes is a combat-oriented game. While optional, fighting is a key part of Call of Heroes. It is one aspect that Call of Heroes excels at over its alternatives: combat is faster, more dynamic and more interesting overall, with simpler rules, but more possibilities for strategies and tactics. Combat usually happens on a grid of squares, with every player and monster taking turns to move, attack and cast magic spells!\nUnlike RPG video games (World of Warcraft, Skyrim, etc), in tabletop RPG's, a Game Master can create any world and story they want (based on some rules) and players can essentially do anything they want in that world or story, without being limited to narrow dialogue options or only certain mechanics.\nIn a tabletop RPG, the players can do _anything_ (or at least try)! It becomes the Game Master's responsibility to narrate what happens, play the role of non-player characters and monsters, come up with fair encounters and make the experience fun for the players. Having fun is the most important!\nThe Game Master is not the player's enemy - it is the narrator, referee and, usually, host of the game; their goal is to provide exciting experiences and stories for the players and keep the game balanced and impartial.\n\nA tabletop RPG is not constrained by graphics. A lot of people play on a table, with grids/mats and miniatures as characters (like in a board game). But this is not entirely necessary! Many people play without any visual aid at all, and it's all \"theater of the mind\"!\nNowadays, there are online platforms to play tabletop RPG's. These offer the Game Master tools for creating maps, \"tokens\" that represent player characters and enemies (like 2D sprites or even 3D models that can be placed on the map) and even playing environmental music.\nAnd like in a board game, there are rules for both players and the Game Master to ensure that the game is fair and fun for everyone. Every player's character must have strengths and weaknesses.\n\nWhen players want to do something, like shooting a bow or negotiating with an NPC, the result is often determined by rolling dice.\n",
    "How do groups work?": "If you want to play, sometimes it's as easy as creating a character outside of a game, finding a group to play with via an online platform and just joining the game.\nHowever, tabletop RPG's can be so much more than just a one-time experience!\n\nMany GM's choose to run 'campaigns', which is a series of game sessions that continue from one play session to another, and expand into an overarching story and develop the players' characters' personalities and powers.\nThus, if you want it to be a more intricate experience, you should find a group that fits you; make sure you get on well with everyone else and everyone is on the same page when it comes to playing.\n\nEach GM is different. A GM might run a story based on the Lord of the Rings books or in some made up world. Some GM's have different styles of playing - some are more focused on telling a story, others are more focused on giving the players options. Some are friendly, some... less so.\nUltimately, just like finding a group to play board games with, you all should have roughly the same expectations and mindset. Some games are more relaxed, drinking and eating pizza. Some are more intense and take things seriously. If you find a group, make sure you ask what kind of group they are.\n\nMost groups have one Game Master and between 3 and 6 other players who play as individual characters.\nThe recommended sweet spot for Call of Heroes is one Game Master and 4 to 5 other players.\n\nA play session can last as long as the group desires. Usually, you should dedicate at least 1:30 to 2 hours to a play session. A lot of players find they want to keep going after that, since time flies fast when you're having fun and making progress through the story!\n",
    "How is it different from a board game?": "A board game is limited by its physical pieces (cards, miniatures, board, etc).\nA tabletop RPG does not have to be limited by anything.\nWhen you buy a board game, you expect to be able to play the whole game with everything that comes in the box.\nHowever, to play Call of Heroes, you don't need anything from the box. In fact, you don't even need to buy anything! Don't want to buy mats or print out maps? Use sheets of paper and draw the board on them directly. Don't have miniatures? Use pretzels and bottle caps (sounds stupid, but it works; and we're also pretty sure you can find better replacements for them as well).\nThere is no stigma in the tabletop roleplaying community for improvizing your own gaming set. In fact, it's encouraged! Many people like making terrain and props to use in their tabletop games.\n",
    "What is a story or adventure like?": "Slay monsters, get treasure\nThe 3 pillars (33% each)\n",
    "What should I buy to get started?": "Nothing.\nAll you need to play are the rules and, of course, a group of people.\nAll the rules for the players are free and accessible online on this website.\nWe do, though, recommend you get a set of D&D Dice (it contains a 4-sided die, 6-sided die, 8-sided die, 10-sided die, 12-sided die and 20-sided die). Rolling dice is a very fun aspect of tabletop RPG's! However, if you don't have access to a set of dice, there are plenty mobile or online apps that simulate dice rolling. You should be able to buy a generic set of such dice for a maximum of $10 at a gaming store (as of 2022).\n",
    "How do I get started?": "It might be daunting to learn all the rules by yourself. But fret not; since Call of Heroes is mainly inspired by Dungeons and Dragons, you fill find a lot of people who play D&D and will be willing to try CoH with you!\nThe easiest way to get started is to find someone who already knows how to play Call of Heroes and ask to join their game, or ask them to host a game for you and some other friends.\nIf you want to try Call of Heroes specifically and you have experience with Dungeons and Dragons (5th edition or One D&D), see the page \"D&D to CoH transition guide\". It will provide you an easy introduction to Call of Heroes from a D&D perspective.\nIf you never played a tabletop RPG but you have friends who have played Dungeons and Dragons, send them a link to the \"D&D to CoH transition guide\" page!\nIf you decide to play online, there are several platforms for playing Call of Heroes that simulate real life tables with miniatures, dice, music, etc. As of 2023, the most popular such platform is Roll20 (https://roll20.net). It is free for all players and Game Masters alike and supports many roleplaying games, including Call of Heroes.\n",
    "Learning the Rules": "Feel free to follow this guide to learn how to play the game. Both in the book and on the official website, you will find clarifications for each and every rule. When in doubt, search it up on the website or consult the table of contents of the book for that rule.\nAside from this written guide, there is also a video guide for both new and experienced roleplayers on our official YouTube channel or on the official Call of Heroes website.\n\nTo be a player in a game, you need a Character! Don't worry about creating a character for now.\nFor the rest of this guide, assume you are playing as a short and skinny, sneaky Gnome. That is your character! We'll name him Don. Yes, in this story, you are Don.\n",
    "Dice": "Before we begin, you need to know about dice.\nDice rolling is a core component of Call of Heroes. Whatever you want to do, it is likely you will need to roll a die for it to determine if you succeed or fail, either as a Player Character or as an NPC or monster.\nIn the world of tabletop roleplaying, there exists one standard set of \"polyhedral\" dice - whether they are Dungeons and Dragons dice or Pathfinder dice, they are all the same and they all work.\nA set of such dice contains 7 special dice: a 4-sided die, a 6-sided die, an 8-sided die, two 10-sided dice, a 12-sided die and a 20-sided die. Only one such set will suffice for playing Call of Heroes to its full extent, though the more dice you have, the merrier!\nEach of these dice contains one number on each face: the 4-sided die goes from 1 to 4, the 6-sided die (normal die) goes from 1 to 6, and so on.\nWherever you live, you can buy a set of roleplaying dice for less than $10 (as of 2023), usually at a board game shop or a gaming store, or, if you can't find any, you can order them online. If you can't afford that, there are plenty of mobile dice simulators. Just search \"dice\" on your mobile application store and there should be several free applications that mimick dice rolling!\nIf you decide to play online and not at a real table, however, you don't need to buy dice and can just use online dice rolling simulators. There are many platforms for online roleplaying and they all incorporate dice rolling simulators.\n",
    "Dice notation and calculations": "Whenever you see a notation like \"d4\", \"d6\", \"d8\", etc, these mean \"4-sided die\", \"6-sided die\", \"8-sided die\", etc.\nSo, a die with 4 sides is called a \"d4\", a die with 6 sides is called a \"d6\", etc. \nIf you see \"d4\", that means you're supposed to roll a 4-sided die and take that result.\nIf you see \"d6\", that means you're supposed to roll a 6-sided die and take that result. And so on and so forth.\n\nIf you are ever in doubt about what a certain dice notation means, you can ask your other team mates or the Game Master - one of them will surely know!\n\nCall of Heroes is a \"d12 system\", unlike Dungeons and Dragons and Pathfinder, which are \"d20 systems\". This simply means that you will use the d12 die for _a lot_ of things in Call of Heroes. The 12-sided die will be your best friend while playing Call of Heroes, so learn which one it is! Frankly, we believe it is also the prettiest die of them all! Just look at that perfect shape... beautiful!\n",
    "How does it play out?": "Here is how a standard game session plays out:\nWhen everyone sits down at the table and is ready to start playing, the Game Master will start telling you how the story begins. This is usually narration in the 2nd person, addressing you all at the same time.\n\"You are all sitting around a camp fire, deep in the woods. It is a cool Autumn day and the sky is clear of clouds. You are surrounded by thick shrubbery and your shadows dance as the flame flickers\".\nYou and your fellow players can choose to do, well, anything, at any point during the story. However, you should refrain from interrupting the Game Master while they are talking. Generally, you can ask the Game Master for any more information you think you need, and the Game Master might or might not tell you, depending on the story they are telling.\nHowever, a clear sign that you _can_ do something is if the Game Master says \"what do you do?\". That is your time to shine as a team.\n\"Suddenly, a bear appears out of the thicket. What do you do?\"\nAnd there is no correct answer. You, together, as a team, decide what you want to do. Do you want to scare off the bear? Do you run? Do you hide? Do you want to shoot an arrow at it? Do you want to cast a magic spell at it and set it on fire? Do you want to do... nothing? Of course, each of you can do something different if you have different opinions on what the best course of action is, but, fundamentally, you are all in this together.\nIf you want to do something, simply say it out loud! \"I want to hide from the bear\" or, more directly, \"I hide from the bear\" (generally, when a player says \"I\" or \"Me\", they refer to their character; if you don't feel comfortable using \"I\", use \"my character\", like \"My character wants to hide\" or \"I want my character to hide\"). Or, you could ask the Game Master clarification questions like \"Does my character know the bear's intentions?\" or \"Do I see other bears in the darkness?\". Situations might hide secrets!\nThis repeats on and on: the Game Master describes a situation, and you all decide how to resolve that situation. Usually, the Game Master has prepared in advance your possibilities, but, a lot of the time, the Game Master's job is to improvise and know how to deal with whatever the players decide they want to do. Being a good GM takes a lot of practice and time invested, but it is worth it!\n\nNormally, there is no \"turn order\" in which players do things. Anyone can do anything at any point in time. Nonetheless, the GM might impose an order in which each player can say what they want to do, to keep everything organized.\nHowever, there _is_ a turn order when it comes to fighting! If the players engage in a battle to the death, there will be an order in which everyone can say what they want to do! But more on that later.\nFor now, we're concerned with this bear that's appeared near our campfire.\n\nYou want to _do something_. Will you succeed?\n",
    "Checks": "So, you want to _do something. How do you determine if your character succeeds or fails at it?\nWhenever you (your character) want to do something that requires some effort, that will usually require you to make roll Check.\nA Check is a d12 die roll - you roll a 12-sided die to determine how well you do. If you get a 1, 2 or 3, that is usually pretty bad, while 10, 11 or 12 are pretty good numbers and have a higher chance to succeed.\nYou as the player don't know how high you have to roll to succeed - the Game Master knows it, though, and you must trust that they are playing it fairly.\nWhether you fail or succeed, the Game Master will let you know what happens! The GM might say \"You try to hide behind a tree, but the bear's keen sense of smell detects where you are\" if you fail, or \"You successfully hide behind a tree, without the bear noticing\" if you succeed.\nWhenever not sure what you can do, ask the GM!\n\nHowever, how well you do is not all completely random. Naturally, a short, skinny Gnome should be better at hiding than most, and a bulky barbarian should normally be better at lifting heavy objects than most.\nThat is where your character's stats come in!\n",
    "Stats": "Each Character's has 5 Stats: Might, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma.\nTogether, they represent your Character's capabilities. When you create your character, each of them will range from -1 to 3, but they are generally balanced so you have some higher Stats and some lower Stats.\nStats are just some numbers that represent how good your character is at that particular thing. Having -1 in a Stat means you are below average at that (yikes!), having 0 or 1 in a Stat means you (your character) are average and having 2 or 3 means you are above average or great at it!\n\nMight refers to how physically strong the character is and how much physical effort and pain the character can endure. If you have 0 Might, it means your character is pretty average at physical strength.\nDexterity refers to how agile the character is, how good its reflexes are, how well it can maintain balance, etc. If you have 3 Dexterity, you are _really_ agile, and really good at those things!\nIntelligence refers to how many things the character knows, how well it does with magic and how good their memory is. If you have -1 Intelligence, it means the character is (no offense) fairly dumb.\nWisdom refers to how good your intuition and senses are and how strong your willpower is. A 1 in Wisdom means you have average senses and willpower.\nCharimsa refers to how well you do in social situations, both verbally and with body language. A 2 in Charisma means you are a good communicator and people usually like you!\n",
    "Checks Continued": "Let's get back to Checks. Whenever you make a Check, you add one of the appropriate Stats to the d12 roll.\nSo, if you want to hide, that fits with the Dexterity Stat, so you roll a d12 and add your Dexterity to that. If you are the short, skinny and sneaky Gnome and your Dexterity is 3, you roll a d12 and add 3 to the result. That is the result of your Check.\nThe Game Master will usually tell you what Stat to use for a certain Check.\n\nOnly the Game Master knows how high the result of your Check has to be to succeed, but, as a general rule of thumb, most medium to difficult tasks will require you to get at least a 10 (with the d12 + the Stat).\n\nThose are all the rules for regular Checks! But if you are a maths-savy person, you will notice that even if you have the highest number in a Stat, that is still only a 50% chance to succeed. So, to combat this, there are plenty of special Abilities that allow you to add more numbers to Checks - in some special cases, you can get even up to +15 to Checks!\nDon't worry about it for now. Call of Heroes is very straight-forward. If you can add more numbers to a Check, you will see it explicitly written on something your Character can do.\nBut there are no other general rules for Checks. Unless you see an exception explicitly written on your Character's sheet, that's all you need to know for Checks!\n",
    "Combat": "If you decide to engage in combat (or the enemies ambush you), the way things play out change slightly.\nTactical combat is a large part of what makes Call of Heroes unique and an improvement over other systems.\nIn combat, you can no longer make decisions whever you want, but you have to take them on your turn. Combat in all RPG's play more similarly to a board game in which you have more freedom.\nFirst things first, let's talk about the turn order.\n",
    "Turn order (and Initiative)": "Turn order is determined by rolling a d12 and taking turns in order from the highest to the lowest.\n\nLet's say you are 4 players, and are ambushed by 3 bears. You can't just say \"I shoot an arrow at the bear\" and do it immediately. You must respect the turn order, because maybe the bears are faster than you!\nBut how do you determine the order in which everyone acts? By rolling a d12, of course!\n\nTo determine combat turn order, every player rolls for \"Initiative\", meaning you roll a d12 and add your Dexterity and your Charisma to the roll.\nSince your Dexterity is 3 and your Charisma is 2 (as the short sneaky Gnome that you are), that means you roll a d12 and add 5 to the result. That's pretty good!\n\nEveryone takes their turn in order of how high they rolled. Whoever rolled the highest goes first.\nIn Call of Heroes, monsters and non-placed characters don't roll for Initiative, but instead just have a number. Bears, for example, have 10 Initiative by default.\n\nSo, if you roll above 10, you go before the bears.\nSince bears all have the same initiative, they take their turns one by one, one after another (or, if the GM decides so, they could take their turns all at the same time).\n\nAfter everyone rolls for Initiative, it's time to fight (in order of initiative).\nEveryone (and the bears) take turns to do what they want to do, and then again and again until combat is over (AKA all enemis die, all players die, you run away, you negotiate a truce, etc).\n",
    "Health": "How much you can resist in combat is determined by your Health Points. Every living thing in the game has Health Point (or just Health, or HP).\nYou as a character have a set amount of Health Points determined by how you created your character.\n\nWhenever you take Damage, you subtract that many points from your current Health Points.\nIf someone reaches 0 or less Health Points, they die (or at least fall incapacitated).\nProtect these Health Points as best you can, because they represent your life!\n\nAs the sneaky Gnome you are, let's say you have a total of 12 Health Points.\nDuring your day of adventuring, you will undoubtedly fight enemies, fall in traps and hurt yourself.\nWhenever that happens, you will lose some of your Health Points.\n\nYou regain all of your lost Health Points back when your character takes a 7-day break from adventuring in-game; this is called a Long Rest.\nLong Rests have nothing to do with real world time. You can just say \"Let's take a Long Rest\" and the Game Master might just say \"Done, 7 days have passed.\".\n\nDuring the gaming session, you will have to keep track yourself of how many Health Points you have, either on a sheet of paper or in a document. Don't cheat!\nYour total amount of Health is calculated when you create your character; we'll get into that a bit later.\n",
    "Your Turn": "When it's your turn in combat, you can A) Move and B) use your Action (in any order).\nEveryone can take an Action in combat and Move. Let's begin with moving.\n",
    "Moving": "When you decide to move, you can run a few meters in any direction, spending on your Speed.\nAs a Gnome, your Speed is 4 meters per turn (the Speed of all Gnomes is 4 meters per turn). That means you can run 4 meters once per turn.\n4 meters is just the maximum number of total meters you can move. You can move 2 meters up and 2 meters to the left, or move only 3 meters in any direction, or not move at all! It's up to you how you move.\n",
    "Actions": "Player Characters can all make one Action on their turn. This can mean attacking, casting a magic Spell, or anything you can think of that uses your hands (usually).\n\nThe most standard way to take your turn is to move once and then attack once (or attack and then move).\nIf you want to do something that uses both hands, that's an Action.\nBut what if you want to do something different with each hand? That's where Half-Actions come in.\n",
    "Half-Actions": "Half-Actions are exactly what they sound like: using only one hand to do something is a Half-Action, and using both hands to do something is an Action.\nEssentially, on your turn, you can make 2 Half-Actions (which is the same as an Action).\nAny Action is just two Half-Actions combined. You want to attack with a 2-Handed Swords? That's 1 Action, AKA 2 Half-Actions. You use both your hands for this, and since one hand means one Half-Action, that's simply the same as one Action.\nThe term \"Action\" is just another word for \"two Half-Actions\".\n\nIf you choose to do so, you can even make a Half-Action with one hand, move 4 meters, then make another Half-Action.\n\nBut it gets better! You don't actually need to keep track of which hand you used already! It doesn't matter you already used your right hand to make a Half-Action.\nOn your turn, you have 2 Half-Actions. Period. They are not tied to one hand or the other in particular. You want to make 2 Half-Actions with the same hand? You are free to do so!\nIf you have a shield and a 1-Handed Sword, yes, you can make 2 attacks with the same hand with the same sword. But don't worry about the numbers; the game is balanced around this.\n\nIn the future, when your character becomes more advanced, some Abilities will give you more Actions per turn! If you have a total of 2 Actions on your turn, that's exactly like having 4 Half-Actions. And you'd be able to make 4 attacks with the same hand and weapon, or one attack with a 2-Handed Weapon and 2 attacks with 1-Handed Weapon. You're free to do whatever you want with your hands!\n",
    "Attacking, Weapons and Defense": "When you attack with a weapon, you roll the weapon's dice and subtract the enemy's Defense.\n\nEvery weapon in the game does a certain amount of damage and all weapons can be found on the Weapons page.\nEvery weapon also benefits from either your Might or your Dexterity.\nFor example, a Club deals 1d8 Damage and uses the Might Stat. So, whenever you attack with the Club, the damage done by that attack is 1d8 + your Might. If you are the sneaky, slim Gnome, that means 1d8 - 1, which is not very good.\nThe Dagger, however, deals 1d6 + 1 damage and uses Dexterity. Thus, if you are the sneaky Gnome, the damage will be 1d6 + 4, which is much better!\n\nYou roll the damage, and the enemy subtracts the damage you deal from their Health Points. Your job is to get them to 0 or less Health.\n\nHowever, every character and monster has another number called Defense. Whenever it is attacked, their Defense reduces the amount of damage they take by that amount.\nFor example, if you attack the Bear and the attack would deal 7 damage, the Bear does not just lose 7 Health, but instead subtracts its Defense from the attack.\nBears' Defense is 4, so, whevener the Bear is attacked, it reduces all incoming damage by 4. 7 becomes 3. That's the final amount of damage the Bear takes.\n\nTo conclude, the final damage of your attack is: (Weapon Damage) + (your Might or Dexterity) - (enemy Defense).\nIn this particular case with you being the Gnome and the enemy being the Bear, the total damage is (1d6 + 1) + (3) - (4).\n\nNo matter if you use a 1-Handed Weapon (with Half-Actions) or a 2-Handed Weapon (with Actions), the formula is the same. Even if you use both hands, the formula doesn't change. It's always the same.\n\nRemember the magic formula for attacking: Weapon + Stat - Defense.\n\nThat's pretty much it for attacking! The next section will go a bit more into detail about some other tips and tricks for combat!\n",
    "Why Your Positioning Matters": "While on paper combat seems like a randomness fest, there are many other things that influence combat.\nOne of the most important is positioning. If you shoot an arrow at an enemy behind a wall, it will obviously not be as efficient as if the enemy was standing in an open field.\nIf you fall from above onto an enemy, that's more effective than just attacking normally.\nThere is even a bonus for doing a cool stunt!\n\nDuring combat, there are all sorts of extra small bonuses or minuses you can get on your attacks, depending on how well you are positioned.\nDon't bother with memorizing them for now. The Game Master will tell you when the time comes. Just remember positioning matters. If it makes sense that you ever get a penalty to an attack, you probably do. Ask the Game Master.\nIf you want to see all of these penalties and bonuses, you can check the Attack Bonuses and Penalties page.\n",
    "Abilities": "An Ability is simply a block of text that either gives you some thing extra (passively) or gives you something else to do with your Actions rather than attacking.\nEvery Race and Class gives you some special Abilities. You will know you have these Abilities if they are written on your character sheet.\nIf you are a Gnome, you have some extra Abilities that Elves don't have.\n\nLet's take a look at exactly what Abilities you start with as a Gnome!\n\nFirst off, you have Inherited Tastes. You can see it's a Passive Ability, meaning you don't need to use it manually; it's always there, in the back of your mind. It's like an extra trait for your character.\nInherited Tastes is very simple. You don't have a sense of taste, but your eyes perceive colors sharper than most. Doesn't sound like much, but it is an Ability!\n\nThen, let's look at Lucky Presence. This one is an Ability that you can actually use!\nAfter someone else makes a Check, you can say \"I use Lucky Presence\" and they must roll the check again. Presumably, you would use this on your allies when they fail a Check, or on your enemies when they succeed a Check you would've liked them to fail.\nThere are 2 interesting things about this Ability: the first one is that it's a \"Reaction\". Reaction is another type of Action that you can only do on others' turns. You can't do just anything with Reactions. Every Reaction is usually an Ability that has a specific time when you can use it. In this case, you must use Lucky Presence when someone makes a Check.\nThe second thing to look at is the hourglass icon near which it says \"Long Rest\". This is called a Cooldown and it tells you how long you have to wait before you can use this Ability again after you use it once. If it has a Cooldown of Long Rest, that means you can use it once, and then you must finish a Long Rest before you can use it again.\n\nThat's all the Abilities Gnomes start with! Let's take a look at another Ability now, to see another example. We'll look at the Spell called Bonfire.\nBonfire is a magical Spell, and it is only available to spell casters, like Mages and Shamans. When you cast this, you choose 1-cubic-meter zone where a bonfire is conjured, and it deals damage! The Aability text itself is self explanatory and straight-forward.\nBonfire takes 1 Action to do. So, on your turn, you'd have to choose between attacking and casting Bonfire. Reminder that 1 Action is the same as 2 Half-Actions. So if you cast Bonfire, you can not do anything else with your hands this turn! And if you use one hand for a Half-Action, you can't cast Bonfire; because you are left with a Half-Action, and Bonfire takes 1 whole Action.\nThe last thing to notice about Bonfire is the arrow-and-target icon where it says \"6 meters\". This simply means the spell Bonfire has a maximum range of 6 meters. The space you choose to cast Bonfire on must be within 6 meters of you (and you must be able to see the location, of course).\n\nLet's look into an Ability that's a little more _Advanced_, Healing Surge.\nThe text is very short and straight-forward - you restore 2d6 Health to a Unit. \nThe \"Half-Action\" and \"5 meters\" tags should also be self explanatory for you by now.\nThe \"1 Mana\" text refers to the cost of this Ability. The next section will explain Spellcasting.\n  \n",
    "Abilities Notes": "Generally, you will have to find a way to keep track of your Abilities. Sure, you can just write down the name of each Ability you have, but then you'd have to search it online every time you want to do something. The easiest way to keep track is with the Ability Sheet Generator, which can be found at this link.\n",
    "Spellcasting": "Every character has a type of \"spellcasting\", and it's always one of the following: Mana-based or Insight-based.\nYou will see the word Spell - all Spells are Abilities. A Spell is just a normal Ability, but it's magical by nature.\nLet's start with Mana-based, since it's the simpler one.\n",
    "Mana-based Spellcasting": "Clerics, Mages, Rogues, Warlocks and Warriors use a system of points called Mana Points.\nYou have a number of Mana Points that you can spend to cast some Spells, and you regain all Mana Points back when you finish a Long Rest (7 in-game days of non-adventuring).\n\nFor a clear example, let's take a look at the Mage Class. As written on the Mage rules page, Mages start with 3 Mana Points. The Mage can choose to spend these points on casting Spells.\nEach Spell specifies if and how many Mana Points it costs to cast. If you decide to cast Healing Surge, you must expend one Mana Point and then you are left with 2 Mana Points. It doesn't specify that Healing Surge has a Cooldown, so you can do it even twice per turn (since it takes a Half-Action) as long as you have enough Mana Points. If you don't have enough Mana Points to cast a Spell, you simply can't.\n\nWhen building your character, you will have to choose a number of Spells from a given list - you can't have them all, there are dozens in the game! You'll pick a few Spells to have at hand. Mages, for example, start out with 4 + your Intelligence Spells. So, if your Intelligence is 3, you must pick 7 out of all the Spells Mages can choose from. These will be all the Spells you will be able to Cast until you finish your next Long Rest (7 in-game days of non-adventuring).\nThis is explained in further detail later on, at Character Creation.\n\nYou can keep track of your Mana Points on a sheet of paper, with marbles, dice, etc. It is your job to keep track of your Mana Points. Don't cheat!\n",

    "Wrapping up the basics": "Those are all the basics of the game! You can now play the game with your group!\nAs mentioned several times, don't bother with remembering _everything_. It's merely good to have a general overview of how the game works before you get into it. It is always recommended you find a group where at least one person has experience playing any tabletop RPG, be it Pathfinder, Dungeons and Dragons or Call of Heroes. And if they have player D&D or Pathfinder but they are new to CoH, send them the D&D Transition Guide! It's a guide specifically for D&D players who want to learn Call of Heroes and explains all the differences and changes.\n",
    "Character Creation": "Building a character is one of the most fun aspects of the game and provides you with a way to express what kind of person you want to be in the adventure. While some adventures come with premade characters (like Don, the sneaky Gnome you were assigned in the previous sections of this guide), most games will have you make your own character.\nThis section will guide you through all the steps for building a new character.\n",
