    "Distance": "When calculating distance from point A to point B, calculate the distance from the square A is on to the square B is on like this:\nStart from a square near A and count squares one by one (in a line or diagonally) until you get to B. You also count the square B is on for this.    \nRemember this by thinking that if A is on the corner of B, that's a distance of 1 meter.\n",
    "Area of Effect Distance": "For Abilities that affect areas, the distance is calculated to the edge square of the area.\nE.g. for a 4x4 meter area, if the range is 6 meters, there should be a path of 5 empty squares between the caster and the area.\n",
    "Line": "If a spell targets a line, it starts from, a square right in front of you and continues in a line.\nE.g. if the line is 2 meters long, it takes the square in front of you, and the next one.\n",
    "Cone": "Angle:\nMost cones in the game are 90 degree cones.\nOn a grid, you can position a cone in 2 ways:\nWith the edges diagonally on the grid (thus forming a 'stair').\nWith one edge vertically and one horizontally on the grid.\nSee the picture.\nOf course, you can rotate the shapes to your pleasing.\n\nShape:\nThe length of the cone dictates the maximum distance from the caster to the farthest squares of the cone.\nIf the cone is stair-shaped, it always takes the shape of a quarter of a square, like in the picture.\nIf the cone's edges are vertical/horizontal, the cone effectively takes the shape of a square, due to how distance math works. See Distance.\nNotice how in all of these examples, the farthest square is always the same distance from the base square.\n\nPosition:\nYou can choose to position the cone like this:\nIf stair-shaped, you can start the cone with the base square from your left/right/up/down square OR from the square you are on.\nIf vertical/horizontal, you can start the cone with the base square from any square near you OR from the square you are on.\n"
