    "Distance": "When calculating distance from point A to point B, calculate the distance from the square A is on to the square B is on like this:\nStart from a square near A and count squares one by one (in a line or diagonally) until you get to B. You also count the square B is on for this.    \nRemember this by thinking that if A is on the corner of B, that's a distance of 1 meter.\n",
    "Area of Effect Distance": "For Abilities that affect areas, the distance is calculated to the edge square of the area.\nE.g. for a 4x4 meter area, if the range is 6 meters, there should be a path of 5 empty squares between the caster and the area.\n",
    "Line": "If a spell targets a line, it starts from, a square right in front of you and continues in a line.\nE.g. if the line is 2 meters long, it takes the square in front of you, and the next one.\n"
