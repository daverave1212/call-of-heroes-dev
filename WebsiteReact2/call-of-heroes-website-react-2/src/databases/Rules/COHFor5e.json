    "About The Game": {
        "What is Call of Heroes?": "Call of Heroes is a modern tabletop roleplaying game made to be better than Dungeons and Dragons on all levels (5th Edition or One D&D). The game is easier to learn, play, host games for as a Game Master and provides more combat options and strategies packed in a simpler set of rules.\nWe created this game out of love for tabletop roleplaying games and disappointment with many aspects of existing systems. Our CoH community feels many aspects of the traditional tabletop games are lackluster and not designed for the modern world. It is a game in the same genre as D&D and Pathfinder: it's made for a fantasy setting, has turn based combat, etc. If you played either of these systems, you will find CoH very easy to pick up!\n",
        "Is this a D&D offspin?": "No. It's a different game. However, Dungeons and Dragons and Pathfinder are the main inspiration sources for Call of Heroes.\nWhile exploring the rules of Call of Heroes, you will find a lot of simplification for the better. Many features are removed and tweaked, and other features have been added, all for the sake of modernization and ease of play without taking away from the fun parts. We have removed what's not fun and made what's already fun even more exciting! However, Call of Heroes is not merely a modification of D&D. It is not a form of 5.5th Edition or an offspin. It's an entirely different game and should be treated as such. Content is not backwards compatible with neither D&D or Pathfinder - but it is better!\n",
        "Why Call of Heroes and not D&D?": "Blalaflala\n"

    "CoH For D&D Players": {
        "D12 System": "Call of Heroes is a d12 system instead of d20. When you make a check, you roll a 12-sided die and add any modifiers to it.\n12 sides instead of 20 sides makes Checks less swingy and makes adding numbers easier.\nCritical successes and failures can happen when rolling a d12 - if you roll 12 on the die, that counts as a Critical Success and it counts as if you rolled 15.\nRolling a natural 1 is not considered a Critical failure. Instead, a Critical Failure happens when your total result is 0 or less (from a negative modifier, like having -1 in a certain Stat).\n\nWhen in combat, there is no rolling to hit - you roll damage directly and subtract Defense.\nHowever, Critical Strikes do exist in combat as well, but they are specific to various weapons and Spells. If a weapon or Spell can Critically Strike, it is mentioned in the weapon/Spell text (with what needs to happen for it to be a Critical Strike).\n",
        "Characters": "This section explains the basics of the player characters. Later sections describe how combat works and how Game Mastering is different from other systems.\nLike in D&D, a character is defined by a Race, a Class and a Background. Each Class has a different set of specializations and each Race a set of extra Feats.\nEach Specialization provides tons of options for character customization!\n",
        "Player Character Progression": "In Call of Heroes, characters go from Level 1 up to Level 10. In terms of how much time and experience it takes to get from 1 to 10, it's not the equivalent of getting from 1 to 20 in D&D.\nIn fact, getting from Level 1 to Level 10 in Call of Heroes is slightly faster than going from Level 1 to Level 10 in Dungeons and Dragons.\n\nHowever, the levels _are_ more packed and flavorful than in D&D!\nEvery 2 Levels, you get to pick a class Talent from 3 to 4 choices. These are talents are usually powerful Abilities that define your playstyle! This means that, judging only by the number of Talents, each Specialization has over 500 possible Talent combinations, and that's not even counting your starting Racial Talent, feats and other Class choices (e.g. Warlocks and Clerics get another set of extra Talents at Level 1). Pick your poison!\nLeveling up happens either through Experience Points awarded by the GM (from killing monsters, completing puzzles, etc) or through a milestone system (e.g. leveling up after completing a certain part of the story).\n",
        "Character Stats": "Ability Scores (from D&D) are called simply Stats in Call of Heroes.\nThere are 5 Stats in Call of Heroes: Might, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma.\nStrength and Constitution are combined into one single stat: Might. Might affects damage with some weapons and your base Health. The overall Health is determined more by your Class and Talents rather than by your Might. So don't worry! You're not losing on that much Health if you choose to start with -1 Might.\nWhen you create your character, you assign the following numbers in any order to your Stats: 3, 2, 1, 0, -1. Every Character will have one strong Stat and one weak Stat.\nThere are no tables for converting a Stat to a Modifier like in D&D. The Stats themselves are the modifiers. It's that simple!\nYou gain extra Stat Points at Levels 4 and 8 and you can also get extra Stat Points through Feats and Talents.    \nYou might be thinking about how Races affect your Stats. Instead of giving you extra points in some Stats, Races impose some extra rules for distributing Stats. For example, Orcs allow you to put assign your Stats however you like with those numbers as long as your Might is at least 2.\n\nUnlike in D&D, there are no sub-stat Skills (Athletics, Perception, etc). Instead, all Checks are done directly with the Stat and the player can choose in some cases which Stat they want to use.\nInstead, to specialize in different skills, there exist Proficiencies!\nBecause there are too many sub-stats to cover all possibilities, each Race, Class and Background gives characters Proficiency in certain skills of choice.\nProficiencies are worded in such a way that they are applicable to more situations than in D&D! For example, if you have Proficiency in Intimidation, you will get a bonus to all rolls for Intimidation, whether you want to use your Charisma or your Might.\nThis makes the life of both the Game Master and the Players easier. No longer do they have to memorize all 20 sub-skills. If it's jumping, it's either Might or Dexterity! And if a player knows they're good at jumping, they'll just call it out and add the Proficiency bonus.\nThe Proficiency bonus is equal to your Level. So, even if your Intelligence is low, you might still know a lot about Occultism. After all, it makes sense you do if you grew up in a coven of witches...\n",
        "Combat, Turns and Actions": "Just like in D&D, combat happens on a map (preferably on a grid).\nEach player rolls Initiative (1d12 + Initiative) to determine their turn order. Monster usually have a fixed Initiative, so similar monster groups take their turns at the same time, thus increasing the speed of preparation for combat.\n\nIn a turn, a Unit can move up to its speed and use 1 Action, which can be divided into 2 Half-Actions.\nThere is no Bonus Action, but there are plenty of Abilities that cost 0 Actions (are completely free and can do as many as you like per turn).\nLike in D&D, each Unit also has a Reaction they can use during other Units' turns for some situational moves.\n\nHalf-Actions are useful because provide more options during combat. As a general rule of thumb, an action taking 2 hands usually costs 1 Action. If it can be done with one hand, it usually takes a half action.\nDon't worry though! Each Ability is well worded and specifies how many Actions it takes to make.\n\nSaving Throws are simply called Combat Checks and are rolled with the Stat Modifier. Some Talents and Abilities grant you bonus modifiers to certain Combat Checks.\n",
        "Moving": "On your turn, you can move once a number of meters equal to your Speed.\nYou can't divide your Movement around Actions.\nYou can move before or after attacking or casting a spell or doing any action, but once you move once, that's it! You can't move again until next turn!\nNote that you can freely switch direction while moving, if it's in the same movement. If you want, you can move in one direction for a few meters, do a 180 degree turn and move back. That is valid movement, because it doesn't divide the movement around Actions, but it's still the same movement.\n\nHowever, there are several ways to break this rule. There are plenty of Abilities that allow you to move again.\nAnother way to circumvent this is to get the Attack-Move Feat, which allows you to make Melee Attacks and cast non-offensive Spells \"while moving\".\n\nYou might be wondering why it's ruled that way: it prevents \"cheesy\" plays like hiding behind a wall, moving, attacking and moving behind the wall again. It also simplifies the game for both the Game Master and the Players while making Movement a more tactical decision.\n",
        "Attacking and Defense": "To recap, on your turn, you have 1 Action, which can be divided into 2 Half-Actions.\nAttacks with one-handed weapons take a Half-Action and attacks with two-handed weapons take 1 Action.\n\nWhen you Attack with a weapon, you roll directly for damage - there is no rolling to hit. You then subtract the target's Defense from the damage, and that's the final result damage the target takes.\nAssuming you are Trained in the weapon you are attacking with (see Training), the attack deals (weapon base damage) + (your Might or Dexterity, as mentioned by the weapon). Each Weapon is used with either Might or Dexterity. When you attack with a weapon, you roll the weapon's base damage and you add either Might or Dexterity, depending on the weapon.\nFor example, Clubs deal 1d8 damage and use Might as their Stat. So, if you have 3 Might, you will roll 1d8 + 3. If you roll 4 on the d8 and the target has 5 Defense, the final damage is 4 + 3 - 5 = 2 damage. The target takes 2 damage.\n\nSome Spells are considered attacks, in which case they are \"against Defense\" (you subtract the target's Defense, normally, like you would with a weapon attack).\nIf something does not mention it is an attack or is \"against Defense\", then you can assume it deals the damage directly - what you roll is what you deal.\n",
        "Weapons": "As reported by many players, weapons in Call of Heroes are \"cooler than in most RPG's\".\nEach Weapon has a specific special effect that makes it different from all other weapons.\nSome weapons can land critical strikes, while others can deal more consistent damage, heal you, ignore Defense, etc. Check out the Weapons page and choose your favorite!\n",
        "Abilities": "An Ability can either mean a Spell, a feature, a passive trait, etc. It's an all-encompassing word for \"something you can do\". Healing Word is an Ability and also a Spell. Action Surge is an Ability, but not a Spell. Dual Wielding is an Ability, but it's passive (it's always active).\nAbilities are very straight forward, without much fodder text and extra noise.\nAside from the name and marvelously illustrated icon, each Ability clearly states how many Actions it takes, its range, cost, etc.\nAbilities that need disabmiguation have some extra notes attached at the bottom of the Ability box.\n\nMost spells do not have a verbal or material component requirement and can be cast just by using your hands. If you can't use your hands, you can't use Actions and thus you can't cast Spells. That's as simple as it gets!\nThere are some exceptions to this, of course, but if it's an exception, you'll see it written explicitly in the Ability box.\nTidbit - there is a type of Crowd Control called Silence that completely blocks the flow of magic of a caster and prevents all spells from being cast.\n",
        "Spell Casting Systems": "There are two equivalents to the Spell Slot mechanic of D&D: Mana and Insight.\nEach Class, including non-spellcasters like Warriors, uses one of the two systems mentioned above (Mana or Cooldowns).\n\nClerics, Mages, Rogues, Warlocks and Wariors use Mana to cast Abilities.\nMana functions exactly like Spell Slots. However, in Call of Heroes, Spells are not categorised by levels.\nInstead, each Spell costs a number of Mana points and a player's character has a certain number of Mana.\nThus, if you have 5 Mana (that recovers on Long Rest), you can choose to spend 2 of it on a Spell that costs 2 Mana. You'll be left with 3 Mana until your next Long Rest.\nIf a Class is Mana-based, you can prepare a number of Spells from its available lists of Spells (Elemental, Conjuration, Divine, etc) and have them ready to cast. Most of the time, prepared Spells can be changed on Long Rests.\nSome Spells do have a character Level requirements, though! Fire Ball is only usable by Level 4 or above characters!\nPreparing Spells is simply called Knowing or Learning Spells.\n\nIf your class is Insight-based, you can know a number of Spells from your Spell Lists.\nHowever, instead of Mana, you have Insight.        \nIf a Spell displays a _team eye_ icon and a number, then it takes up that much Insight to _know_ it.\nIf you don't have enough Insight left to learn (Know) a Spell, you can't learn it (obviously).\nYou can think of Insight as \"available memory\". Some Spells occupy \"memory\" (Insight).\nMost Insight Spells have a Long Rest Cooldown.\n",
        "Cooldowns": "Cooldown is a term borrowed from video games. It refers to a time you must wait between casts. If a Spell has a cooldown of Long Rest, it means you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.\nCooldowns are generally not based on time, but rather on checkpoints. Once per combat, once per Long Rest, once per Turn, etc.\n",
        "Main Stat and Other": "The equivalent of Spellcasting Ability is the Main Stat.\nThe Main Stat is the one used to determine your Spell DC (called Spell Grade) and it's equal to 6 + Main Stat.\nIn the case of multiple Classes, you can choose between 2 options of Main Stats. If you can choose between Intelligence and Charisma but like Charisma more, feel free to use Charisma.\nThe equivalent of Spell Attack Modifier is the Main Stat itself. But by default, there is nothing to take note of. If you need to add the Main Stat to something, it's explicitly written in the Ability text.\n"
