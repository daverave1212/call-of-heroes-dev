    "Checks": "A simple way to determine the Grade of a Check (the number needed to pass) is to think in multiples of 5 - a Grade of 5 is Easy, 10 is Medium, 15 is Hard, 20 is Very Hard and 25 is Impossible.\n10 for a medium task might sound like a lot (25% success chance on a d12). However, take note that players have up to +3 in their favored Stat, and also Proficiencies. All these will take the success chance up to 50% or more. Furthermore, some Checks might be attemptable multiple times.\n",
    "Check Bonuses": "If a player brings up a good reason for why they should have a bonus to a Check, add 2 to the Check.\n",
    "Check Helping": "If a player wants to help another Player do something that requires a Check, they roll a Check as well, and if they pass, add +2 to the Check of the helped Player.\nAllowing help for Intellgience, Sense or Charisma Checks is discouraged.\n",
    "Player Downtime": "While not adventuring, a player character can spend their time trying to help around in a town or city to make some extra gold.\nFor every 8 hours spent helping around, they can make a Check of choice (and add Proficiency if applicable) and gain that much gold. The GM might lower the gold acquired or not allow certain checks if they don't make sense in some situations (e.g. it's hard to help with Dungeoneering in a peasant village)."
