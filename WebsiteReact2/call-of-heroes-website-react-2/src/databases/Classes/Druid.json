You are passing through a druid's domain, and he or she might just be watching you from the eyes and form of a woodland critter, ready to leap upon you as a mighty wolf, or in the form of an otherworldly creature of the forest. Travelers beware!\nDruids are guardians of their domain, be it a lush forest, a barren wasteland, the peak of a mountain, or the depth of the sea. Most druids can transform into various animals, some even able to invent their own fauna and flora to shape their domain, while others forgo nature entirely to focus on studying the old ways of the cosmos.\nA druid is a spellcaster heavily attuned to their environment, who can shapeshift into animals, cast nature magic and channel the old powers of the stars themselves.\n",
