    "Description": "Years of dedicated study have yielded results, though the scholarship of the dark arts is not akin to the arcane. Standing before you is a woman who does not manipulate the strings of magic - no, she destroys them, weaving a tunnel of sorts to an unfathomable source of eldrich energy that pulses ominously around her, stirring unease into your soul. Out of nowhere, she laughs, and her features soften into a kind smile directed at you. Despite society's rejection, she is no monster. She, too, is human, with emotions and heart, however dark it may be.\nWarlocks are practicioners of the occult or outer magic and techniques beyond the normal domain. Using a blade, fell magic and even stealing powers away from the enemies, each warlock has its own source for their powers, by study, persuasiveness or pure chance.\nA warlock is a spellcaster attuned to the unknown and bizarre, who only needs to rest inbetween fights, and every encounter wakes the power in them anew - this time, sleep is not for the wicked.\n",
