    "Description": "With a resounding impact, the greatsword cleaves through the air, connecting with the beast's tail in a mighty blow. The wyvern wheels around, its massive jaws primed to ensnare the warrior in their deadly embrace. In a daring maneuver, the fighter relinquishes her blade, seizing the wyvern's jaw in a vice-like grip, diverting its momentum towards a nearby tree. She ascends onto the creature's head, plunging her blade deep into its eye with lethal precision. It is then that you observe a miraculous sight: her previously bloody wounds have miraculously sealed, as if cauterized by the scorching heat of battle and the coursing adrenaline of combat.\nWarriors are talented in using any type of weapon, with hand-to-hand combat capabilities way beyond the average adventurer. Brawn and tactics are a warrior's aces in the sleeve.\nA warrior is a physical combatant, but that does not stop them from overcoming challenges. With mastery over arms, body or range, a warrior may improvise and lead their way to victory.\n",
