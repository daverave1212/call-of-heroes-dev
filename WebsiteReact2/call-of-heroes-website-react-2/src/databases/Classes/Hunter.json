A whirlwind of steel and fang ensues, and as a sword is close to striking you, the attack suddenly stops. \"You're no monster\" he says as he unsheathes his sword, searching for tracks in the mud. \"Best mind your own business, friend. The one I'm seeking is nearby... and it is seeking you.\"\nHunters are keen predators, who fight alongside one (or multiple) trusted beastly companions. While able to cast some rudimentary magic, spellcasting is not their focus, and they more than make up in terms of raw ferocity and power to kill.\nA hunter can always navigate their surroundings, and can track down any monster, or person alike, no matter the scope.\n",
