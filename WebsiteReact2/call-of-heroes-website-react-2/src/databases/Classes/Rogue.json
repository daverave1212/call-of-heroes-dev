    "Description": "A hush falls over the bustling city square as a fat pig adorned in a lavish display of gold and diamonds walks around the corner, accompanied by a pair of brutish lackeys, oblivious to the imminent danger lurking in the shadows. concealed within his pocket rests a scroll containing privileged information for his eyes only, or so he believes. Now! A shadowy figure descends upon them, a poisoned blade finding its mark in the unsuspecting guard's back. Swift and precise strikes to the legs, a tap on the shoulder and a trick of the shadows renders the swine isolated in the dim alley. Flee, little pig, and squal in vain - your cries fall upon deaf ears.\nIt is finished. A message stolen, and one conveyed. From whom? That is for the little pig and his friends to determine. After all, it was the quickest way for him to lose weight; he'll have an easier time trotting home.\nRogues are masters of the shadows who focus on subtlety, teamwork or direct combat. While they don't directly cast magic, they can train in the strange arts of shadow techniques - scholars debate wether this is a form of the arcane, psionics or a mere trick of the light. Only rogues know.\n",

Doublespeak is not exactly a language, but a way to carry out private conversations in public by using code words and phrases with double meaning, such that what you say is indistinguishable from a normal conversation. Doublespeak also has a written version; thieves, rogues and streetspeople might use deliberate writing mistakes, punctuation errors or scratch marks on buildings to warn or convey concepts or even entire sentences; these markings are indistinguishable from random scratches to the unaware. Doublespeak is an art in itself - even if every doublespeaker has their own mannerisms and idiosyncracies, one must know and recognize the patterns to be able to speak this language properly, and as such, some even consider it a poetic \"language\".\n",
