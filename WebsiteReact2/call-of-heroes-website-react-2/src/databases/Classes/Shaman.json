    "Description": "A storm gathers strength on the horizon - a sign of the wrathful spirits that stir with agitation. The seer gazes upon you, eyes as white and cold as frost, peering beyond the mundane realm into the shadowed depths of your soul. \"You are not prepared,\" he intones. Another member of the tribe emerges, draped in a hide of a wolf, arms brown and blue inscribed with unknown marks and a hefty axe resting upon his back. \"The ritual must continue\" he declares. \"We are but frail beings, in these mortal vessels, and the spirit realm draws close. Alone, we stand defenseless.\"\nShamans are spirit guides and warriors of the other realm who often engage in ancient rituals and soul magic beyond most mortals' comprehension. Through body, mind or soul, each shaman finds their way to commune with or destroy the spirits haunting or aiding the lands.\nA shaman is a fierce warrior and a powerful spellcaster who taps into their ancestry to empower magic, survive inhumane conditions, or even engage in occult practices to better flow with the world around them.\n",
