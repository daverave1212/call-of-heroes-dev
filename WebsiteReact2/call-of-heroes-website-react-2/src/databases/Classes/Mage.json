The circle is abruptly broken, and the magic stops, as you notice the mage caressing his beard, eyes all on you. Did the spell fail? Could this be a mistake? An error in the code of arcane? Mages work in mysterious ways...\nMages are channelers magic, refiners of the coarse arcane, directly from the source, who can transform those vibrations into elemental energies. Mastery over magics has made their spells fast and efficient, but in their choice of spells and invocations, no two mages are alike.\nWizards are in a continuous study of magic, and their mind is trained for accessing higher-order spells ahead of time, while sorcerers prefer a more random (albeit practical) usage of magic, going with the flow. Artificers are the complete opposite, however, prefering rigurious crafts of trial and error until they excel in their preferred creation field - alchemy, tinkering, even blacksmithing.\n",
