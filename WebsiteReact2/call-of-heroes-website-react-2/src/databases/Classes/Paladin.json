A heavy blow of his lance shatters the enemy's defence line, clearing a path for victory. Radiating with divine energy of righteousness and bearing the standard of his allegiance, the paladin fearlessly presses forward, to victory!\nPaladins are the knights, the crusaders and the vigilantes who bear divine magic through conviction and purpose, perhaps aided by their god, rather than mastery over the arcane. They are able to both heal, resist damage and fell enemies with holy retribution.\nBe it by the sword, by the shield or by the book, paladins join (or form) an order or community of like-minded individuals, and follow their calling into battle - to attack, to protect, to serve for a greater future.\n",
