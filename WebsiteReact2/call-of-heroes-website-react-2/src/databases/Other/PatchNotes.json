    "Update 2024-??-??": {
        "Fumbling Changed (again)": "When a Unit becomes Fumbling, their next Act is completely negated (Movement, attack, or anything that requires Actions). Many Abilities that previously had Fumbling as an effect are now changed (slightly).\nIn other words, a Fumbling Player must spend all of its Movement, a Half-Action, or any number of Actions through Abilities.\nWhy change it: everyone (including me) always forgot to apply the -2 from Fumbling. It's also a pain when you have to think of when to do the -2 -- is it before or after Defense and 50% resistances? Even so, it's more math that the game didn't really need and didn't have that much impact.\nThe new Fumbling is a lot more interesting.\n",
        "Slowed Reverted": "A Slowed Unit's Movement Speed is halved.",

    "Update 2024-10-19 - The PRC Update": {
        "Intro": "Hello everyone!\nThere hasn't been an update in a very long time, but I've been cooking and now is the time!\nThis update focuses on 2 things - tweaks from feedback from D&DCon back in July, and long-awaited reworks to the Cleric, Paladin and Rogue Classes, as well as other smaller tweaks to other things.\n",
        "Rogue Reworked": "Startig with the biggest rework, I am trying several changes to the Rogue class.\nUnlike other reworks, this update contains not 1, but 2 rework variants! Let me know which of them you like the best.\nYou can access them at:\n1) https://questguardrpg.com/Classes/Rogue\n2) https://questguardrpg.com/Classes/RogueB\n\nThere are some general changes to the Rogue class that reflects in all variants.\n- Ambush wording heavily simplified\n- Hide renamed to Stalking and wording heavily simplified (this is to more clearly convey the purpose of the Ability to players, and prevent some naming confusion)\n- Skirmisher renamed to Swashbuckler to better reflect the class fantasy\n",
        "Rogue Variants": "Rogue A (Rogue) I believe is more interesting and the way to go forward with the Rogue Class.\nRogue A has no Mana, but instead gains real, cool Talents every Level (aside from Stat increases).\nRobue B is similar to how it was before -- Rogue B has Mana, but normal Talents.\n",
        "Rogue Ambush Feat": "There is now a Feat that allows you to switch Ambush types if you don't like the default one, from one Specialization to another - Backstabbing Ambush, Sudden Ambush and Isolated Ambush. Pick your poison!",
        "Paladin Reworked": "Reworked the Paladin Class (again)! Most of the Talents and vibe are the same, but the core of the Paladin is now quite different.\nFaith Casting is now more akin to the way Warlocks cast Spells - on a per-Combat basis, and no longer limited to the Divine School.\nHoly Grace is now changed and has no Cooldown - you can spam heal your allies as you please, and also deal some extra Damage. This will combo well with Smite and other Paladin Abilities.\n",
        "Faith Casting": "You do not use Mana.\nEvery Worthy Combat, you can cast up to 2 different Abilities that cost Mana, ignoring the Mana cost.\n",
        "Holy Grace (1 Action)": "Heal an ally for 20% of their Maximum Health (but not yourself).\nYour next attack deals extra Damage equal to the amount just healed.\n",
        "Cleric Reworked": "The Cleric is very similar to how it previously was. In fact, the Level 1 Cleric is identical and the 'Light Cleric' (now Soulwright) is almost identical.\nThe Cleric has received reworks mostly in Talents, and the 'Life Cleric' was once again reworked from the ground up, while maintaining its unusual playstyle with 2 characters.\nCleric Specializations have been renamed to Herald (Light Cleric), Inquisitor (Battle Cleric) and Soulwright (Life Cleric).\n",
        "Cleric of Life": "You now have a 2nd actual and real Player Character, that's either a standard humanoid, a celestial or an undead. Have fun!\nAt Level 5, you can further double-down (or rather triple-down) on this concept and get YET ANOTHER Player Character, for a total of 3 Player Characters that you control!\nEncounter difficulty will increase to match your new friends.\n",

There may be slight tweaks here and there for classes, but the core should remain the same for all of them. As for tweaks, expect some tweaks to the Druid in the future.\n"
    },
    "Update Philosophy & Future Changes": {
        "Intro": "It can be disheartening to see your character becoming obsolete one update after another, and I truly do understand the feeling of seeing your character changed, nerfed or have parts of it removed.\nI assure you, my intention is not to undermine players, prevent them from having fun or make changes just for the sake of change.\nSo let me explain a few things, as well as output a new way of moving forward.\n",
        "Changes & Design Explained": "All changes I make are to further 3 main goals of the game: simplicity, customizability and flow.\nThe game should be simple, choice-wise deep, and game elements should flow together.\nI am also moving forward to adding a 4th goal - having to track less (e.g. Reserve Health, Holy Points, etc).\n\nNerfing races and classes or removing parts of them can feel bad, but ultimately I am concerned with how the class or race feels to start playing, without overwhelming a player who is seeing that for the first time. If things I remove are actually fun, I will put in the Class as a Talent you can get later, or as a Feat or separate choice.\nCertain gameplay aspects objectively do not fit the philosophy and goal of the game. Like the Warlock, who had way too much going on at Level 1, the Summoner and Shaman who were just tables and numbers simulators, etc. That sort of gameplay is not coming back.\nThere are also outliers like the Paladin, which (in my opinion) didn't flow very well, and I am still totally open to changing it again to something that is simple, but fun.\n   \n",
        "Locking in Changes": "There will soon come a time when I will lock-in game features, and say \"This is unlikely to get significant changes in the future\".\nWith this update, I will also let you know what is most prone to change in the future.\nNumbers are more prone to change, however, as I constantly discover miscalculations, or notice something is not balanced properly.\n\nAs time goes on, and more updates come out, \n\nIf a game feature is stable, I will mark it as \"stable\", while other things I will mark as \"unsure\" or \"likely to change\".\nHere is a full list, which I will keep updating moving forward.\n",
        "Core Rules": "The overall flow and rules of combat (Actions, Damage, etc) are *stable*, along with things like Stat Distribution (-1, 0, 1, 2, 3), Mana, etc.\nCrowd Control is *mostly stable* (Dazed, Charmed, Fumbling - *Unsure*).\nMost of the core rules are also *stable*.\n",
        "Races": [
            "All races may get more Racial Ability Choices, or have some Racial Ability Choices changed.",
            "???? Bertle - Baseline stable, RAC likely to change",

        "Classes": [
            "?? Hunter - Mostly stable, though Warden may get some tweaks to flow better",
            "?? Mage - Mostly stable, except for Magic Mastery. Expect a rework of Magic Mastery. Though the rest of it is pretty stable - very simple, thematic, flows well and has a ton of options.",
            "?? Warlock - Mostly stable, though it's most prone to number tweaks",
            "?? Warrior - Mostly stable, but some talents are very long-worded. Expect multiple Talents to be simplified.",
            "?? Rogue - The core idea and the various Ambush mechanics are great, but some Abilities have too much text. Expect some Talent and wording tweaks that may affect how it actually plays out.",
            "?? Druid - Unsure (there are some clunky aspects, like how long the text for Shapeshift is, Day Night Cycle is a bit weird, etc)",
            {
                "Shaman - Unsure (but the core is probably stable)": null
            },

        ]
    },
    "Update 2024-06-16 - Character & Cooldown Update": {
        "Sum Up": "Put on your seatbelts, because this update is a very big one. Here are the focuses of this update:\na) Make Stats more impactful on character creation\nb) Make weapons more accessible\nc) Move away from Once / Adventure Cooldowns\nd) Make Ability Sheets smaller\nThe Stats (Might, Dex, etc) have been reworked, and Leveling Up has also received big changes - it's now easier and more intuitive.\nThere are core weapon changes, no more Weapon Training and some improved rulings.\nSeveral classes have received changes to Once / Adventure Abilities, many of which now have no Cooldown or have a much less strict Cooldown.\nThis update I want to try something strange, which, if it does't work, we'll revert it.\n",
        "Stats Revamped": "Character Creation is receiving a revamp to make Stats more impactful on your build and provide you with more customizability!\nStats are pretty much the same, just the Character Creation is influenced by the stats more now.\n\nMight now further affects Max Health, Dexterity affects Movement, Intelligence affects Known Abilities, Sense affects Health Regen and Charisma affects Initiative.\n\nHealth is calculated as Race Health + 200% of Might.\nMovement is calculated as 5 + 50% of Dexterity (rounded down). Having -1 or 0 Dex = 4 Movement, 1 or 2 Dex = 5 Movement, 3 and 4 Dex = 6 Movement, etc.\n\n_Why It's Changed_ - If you wanted to play a 'martial' character, you had to pick Might or Dexterity as your highest stat. Might was also disproportionate, since it affects both survivability and damage, while Charisma and Sense got the short end of the stick.\nThe new way the Stats work should give players more incentive to try out unusual builds that are all viable, without one Stat being the go-to Stat.\nI don't expect it to be perfect, but I think it's probably the right direction for Stats.\n",
        "Character Creation - New Calculations": [
            "Health = Race Health + 200% Might",
            "Movement = 4 + 50% Dexterity (rounded up). Having -1 or 0 Dex = 4 Movement, 1 or 2 Dex = 5 Movement, 3 and 4 Dex = 6 Movement, etc.",
            "Known Abilities = 2 + Intelligence (with some exceptions). Characters no longer gain +1 Known Ability per Level (I'll explain why below)",
            "Regen = Race Regen + Sense",
            "Initiative = 300% Charisma",
            "Number of Skills = Sense or Intelligence, whichever is higher",
            "Number of Languages = Charisma or Intelligence, whichever is higher"
        ],
        "Intelligence Known Abilities Explained (Tentative?)": "It may sound like I am taking a lot of options away from characters. I've noticed the vast majority of players don't use their Known Abilities to their full potential, and with +1 Known Ability per Level, it is going to quickly clutter up the Ability Sheets.\nI'd rather keep the Ability Sheet simple, and, instead of having _more_ Abilities, I'd rather have _fewer_ Abilities that can _do more_ in and of themselves.\n\nFor a lot of the Basic Abilities, I have changes planned to make them more interactive, flow better and have more possible combos, so fret not.\n\nIt also makes the process of choosing your Abilities more thoughtful.\nFor those of you who still want to have a ton of available Abilities, you can still spec into Intelligence, and there are several ways to get more Abilities as well.\n",
        "Weapons Training \"Reworked\" (Tentative?)": "Getting rid of one more thing on the Character Sheet / Character Creation, to go hand-in-hand with the new Stats.\nThere is now no such thing as Weapon Training. However, weapons now require a minimum certain Stat to wield.\nWeapons that do require MIG or DEX have a slightly better effect, slightly better damage or have a cooler effect.\nAlso, there's one more new aspect to weapons now...\n",
        "Runes": "I want it to be clear for non-MIG and non-DEX characters that weapons are still usable, so I am introducing a new weapon mechanic - Runes.\nAny weapon can be inscribed with one Rune. There are 4 baseline Runes that can be purchased from any regular magic shop.\nMind Rune (makes weapon scale with INT), Spirit Rune (makes it scale with SEN/CHA), Element Rune (makes Damage type Fire/Cold/Shock) and Traditional Rune (removes weapon Stat requirement).\nThis leaves room for other magical Runes that could enchant weapons further and make them stronger (even magic weapons).\n\n_Why It's Added_ - I want SEN/INT/CHA builds to be less restraining. There were already Feats for this (Mastery and Battle Mage), but since Feats are optional, it may not be immediately obvious to players that you can have an INT build, for example, and still have a strong weapon attack.\n",
        "Level Up Changes": "I hope you hate tables as much as I do - removed the Level Up table and replaced it with small choices for Levels 4, 6 and 8.\nLeveling Up should now be a lot more streamlined, knowing you only get some extra stats and whatever the Level Talents say you get. For Levels 4, 6 and 8, you usually get what you used to get before, or a more interesting small choice.\n",
        "Health & Regen Changes": [
            "Adjusted Health and Regen for most Races, but, overall, Starting Health increased by 2 for all Races. Vigor removed from Paladins and Warriors. This is to account for the new Might Health calculation.",
            "Health / Level reduced by 1 for all Classes. This is because you now get extra Health from some of the Level 4, 6 and 8 Talents."
        ],
        "Cooldown & Cost Updates": "Going forward, I want to move away from Once / Adventuer Abilities, and keep only strong Abilities as Once / Adventure.\nIn this update, I am buffing or changing many Abilities to be usable more, either removing the Cooldown completely or changing it to Once / Combat.\nAll animals (Hunter Pets and Druid Animals) have been buffed (no more Once / Adventure Cooldowns, now Once / Combat) and have received tweaks to make them easier to understand and more interesting.\nAlso greatly simplified many of the Feats for Multiracing and removed Mana cost from multiple Feats.\n",
        "Orc Redesigned": "Changed the Orc to be more like the Elf, and not be locked with specific Abilities.\nOrcs now start with the Stat Distribution -1, -1, 3, 3, 3, and can get any number of Racial Abilities they want, but each will cost -1 in a chosen Stat.\n",
        "Ambushing (Changed)": "If one or more Units _want_ to attack another party, and that party would logically have no time to react, everyone rolls Initiative normally, but the ambushing Units gain +5 to the Initiative roll.\n",
        "Percentages (Revert)": "Going back to percentages always being rounded down. Always rounding in the players' favor makes everyone's brain melt slightly more than it should.\nThe final number, after all percentages are calculated, is rounded down.\n",

Expect many more things to be renamed soon, for the same reason!\n",
        "Reworked Elemental Ability List": "The Elemental Spell School felt quite random - it had some interesting spells, but many boring ones, and not many combos to pick.\nNow it's a lot more interesting, with fresh combos, playstyles and strategies to mix and match, and should work much better with Mages and Warlocks!\n*Also, click on the icon!* Gone are the days when the elements are limited - technology has brough us the blessing of _variants_ - try them!\n",

    },
    "Update 2024-01-x": {
        "Sum Up": "This update is a continuation of the previous one, on New Year's Eve.\nIt focuses on removing another character sheet space (Spell Grade) while keeping spells interesting, and improving certain mechanics and rulings, especially Cover, Checks and percentages.\nIt also revises the _Adventure_ system and transforms it into the _Quest_ system.\n",
        "Spell Grade Removed & Crowd Control Buffed": "_Why It's Changed:_ I'd been really thinking of why this number exists. It's just that - a number. With the changes on the wording of Checks, I think this number no longer serves a purpose. The aim of the game is to be as easy to understand as possible, without taking away from complexity. Fare well, Spell Grade! You might be missed, but I won't!\nSpell Grade has been removed and replaced with something else, which differs on a case-by-case basis. Some Abilities require the monster to make a Check (against a specified number or stat), others will have you make the Check instead. Others will have you make a Check against an enemy's Check! Other Abilities will no longer need a Check at all, and the effect simply happens.\nThis works together with the Crowd Control buff - I reanalyzed how strong Crowd Control is and came to the conclusion that a lot of it is not useful enough, mathematically speaking. A lot of Crowd Control Abilities have been made stronger by removing the Check from the enemy, or by making the requirement easier.\nHowever, this is not the case for stronger CC like Stuns and Roots! There is genuinely a lot to unpack - a lot of Abilities have been modified. Check them out!\n",
        "Checks Reworded": "To make it more clear to players and GM's alike, Abilities now state that a Unit make a Check *at least* a number. No more debate of whether getting an equal number is a pass or a fail.\nThere was actually no change to suggested Check difficulty. If you roll a 15, you still pass a \"difficult\" Check or such. The wording is mostly for Abilities.\nI thought this was relevant enough to add to the update notes.\n",
        "Cover, Blind & Percentages (Tentative)": "Made Cover reduce Damage by 50% (tentative).\nYou're free to continue playing with the -2 rule, but I'd love to see some feedback on the 50% rule.\n_Why It's Changed:_ I want to remove as many strange numbers as I can, to reduce the player likelihood of asking \"is this before or after 50% resistance?\". However, if this proves to be too much for just Cover, we'll revert the change.\n\nAll percentages are now calculated in players' favor. If you \"reduce all incoming Fire Damage by 50%\", you take 2 Damage instead of 5, but the monster takes 3 Damage instead of 5. The GM can choose to overrule this.\n_A reminder that percentages are additive - 50% reduction with 50% reduction = 100% reduction, NOT 50% of 50%._\n",
        "Quest System (Tentative)": "Trying out changing the Adventure system to the Quest system. A completed Quest (or Sidequest) is a milestone for the players. When the players reach that milestone in the story (complete a Quest), they regain all resources. In short:\nPlayers regain all resources upon completing a Quest. Players heal for an amount equal to their Health Regen when completing a Sidequest.\nThe Game Master decides what a Completed Quest or Sidequest is - it could be the end of a dungeon, saving someone, or finishing the game session.\nPlayers can relearn Abilities and Talents after completing a Quest.\nA Quest may or may not have a clearly defined start or end.\nAs a GM, feel free to say a Quest is complete whenever you feel the players need to recover their resources. If the players ask \"Was this a quest?\" you have the option to say \"It was a Sidequest\".\n_Why It's Changed:_ There are several reasons I believe Quests may be a better system. While writing the starter adventure Whispervale (spoilers), I realized it's difficult to organize it into Adventures. The Quest system, however, made room for a clearly defined time when players get back their resources. Quests also give a bit more direction to GM's for when to say \"the Adventure is finished\", and with Sidequests, it gives players some more extrinsic rewards for adventuring. Finally, there is a lot more flavor to Quests rather than Adventures - it feels better when you say \"Quest complete!\" than \"Adventure finished\". Quests also act like milestones and thus the reward can be Leveling Up. Need I mention it is also in the name of the game?\n",
        "Other Changes": [
            "Changed Silence - a Silenced Unit can't use **any** Ability (not just Spells).",
            "Changed Cripple - a Crippled Unit deals 100% less Damage.",
            "Changed Blind - a Blinded Unit has 50% less Damage, healing and Checks.",

    },
    "Update 2023-12-31": {
        "Sum Up": [
            "This update is also quite a large one, focusing on reworking a core mechanic, removing/heavily reworking a class and bringing a lot of quality of life improvements to the game and even to the website (Desktop version)"
        ],
        "Reworked Paladin (Tentative)": "Even though the Paladin has been a popular class, I tend to believe it's so due to the class fantasy and certain interesting Abilities, without the core mechanics being very interesting.\nPaladins have been reworked from the ground up and have their own gimmick now: they no longer have Mana. Instead, they can cast any spell they have for free, once per turn, provided they haven't already cast it already.\nAside from that, Paladin specializations have been changed again to be more thematic and play into the class fantasy: Order of the Crusade, Order of the Tome and Order of the Templar, with Talents to double down on Paladin concepts, like being a Black or a White Knight, a Crusader, or even putting your faith on pause.\n",
        "Behind The Design (Paladin)": "Paladins had nothing truly interesting going on - they were simply a class with high stats, high damage and healing.\nThe Talents themselves were quite lackluster except for a few of them. Paladins also required a lot of tracking: tracking mana, tracking Holy Points, tracking Vengeance, etc.\nThis update had several goals for the Paladin: reduce number tracking, make them have an interaction with Basic Abilities and simplify Talent options with more Talent interactions with the core class Abilities and between eachother.\nOverall, even if it feels like Paladins lost some power and the new Faith Casting seems unusual, I believe these will make the Paladin stand out more rules-wise and be easier and more fun to play.\nIf after a while we realize that Faith Casting doesn't work and feel as planned, we'll go back to Mana.\n",
        "Reworked Hunter Core (Tentative)": "To make things more interesting, let's double down on this idea: Hunter now no longer has Mana either... at all.\nTo compensate, several Talents were made stronger, Hunters have normal Health / Level and gain +1 Stat every 3 Levels.\nHunters have also reaceived extra Talents that were previously missing.\n",
        "Behind The Design (Hunter)": "Hunters have always had an unusual power dynamic - the pet is free damage every turn, and can also act as a meat shield, and revived after every combat.\nThat make it so that Hunters had 0 Mana, low Health (which discouraged a more melee playstyle) and could not afford some more powerful Talents.\nRemoving Mana altogether from the Hunter means it can focus on what it does best and what is most fun, without having to trade off power in other areas.\n",
        "Reserve Health is now Health Regen (Tentative)": "After every Worthy combat, automatically heal for an amount equal to your Health Regen, up to 3 times per Adventure.\nHealth Regen is determined by your Race, plus your Level, plus your Might (e.g. 6 + Level, 5 + Level, etc).\nThis makes it much easier to calculate Health Regen (no more recalculating Reserve Health when increasing Max Health), balance Health Regen for some characters, requires less tracking and provides more interesting options.\nAs such, some Races have been rebalanced to be more interesting regarding Health Regen and Max Health.\nThis is a tentative change - if it doesn't work, we'll revert back to Reserve Health, but let's give it a try!\n",
        "Replaces Keyword (Tentative)": "I changed the wording on several Abilities to make them easier to track on a sheet or a sheet of paper.\nSeveral Class Abilities now read as \"Replaces X\". Instead of getting a Passive new Ability that upgrades a different Ability, you get a new Ability altogether that replaces the old one.\nFor most of these, there is no functional change; it's exactly the same. It's just a wording difference.\nLet me know if you feel like this is more intuitive or not.\n",
        "Class Feats": "Some Classes now have Feats! Certain awkward Talents have been made into Feats instead.\nAs always, Feats allow for unique character builds and better customization, all while being completely optional! More is better!\nWe have Talents such as Lich Ritual (now available for Mages and Warlocks too), Old Ritual and Lycanthropy for Druids and Lone Wolf for Hunters. More to come\n",
        "Affliction Feats": "Added a new category for Feats called Afflictions. These are (at first glance at least) negative conditions for the character: missing an arm or a leg, being blind or deaf or having a chronic illness.\nI don't think anyone has played with these so far, but it's a good punishment from the GM in case they want to cut off a leg or two, or be affected by radiation poisoning in the eyes!\n",
        "Humans Reworked": "Humans should naturally be the simplest Race to create and play (and the way they were, Humans were the most difficulty to create). As such, Humans have been greatly simplified.\n",
        "Cool new website updates!": [
            "You can now literally copy a spell and paste it in paint or any image editor. Try it! (as such, removed the Spell Sheet Maker page for now)",

I am forever grateful for all the friends I've made and for all the amazing people I've met, and here's to another year of awesome people and interesting campaigns!\nHere is what I am planning with QuestGuard in the coming year.\n",
        "Dave Campaigns": {
            "1. Starter Adventure": "In the first part of 2024, I will be working on a starter adventure mini-campaign that I will wrap nicely inside a booklet, which will be available either as a separate module or part of the core rulebook.\nI aim for a 4-6 session campaign that's easy to read and introduces all the rules of QuestGuard to new players, one by one, in an easy-to-understand fashion.\nI will most likely run this campaign once or twice, and then hopefully other people can help run it as well to get feedback!\n",
            "2. Ironborn Campaign (?)": "For the current players who took part in Nordheim, I'm planning another campaign or series of mini-campaigns aiming to continue the arcs established in Nordheim.\nThis would take place in the \"Outerworlds\" (placeholder name) where the Ironborn resides. There, the players' new characters will explore a strange and deadly realm and meet old heroes, such as likes of Loki, Flyxer and Ilda, and find out what they've been up to.\nThis is, of course, still heavily in planning; stay tuned, I'll let everyone know if and when this happens!\n"
        },
        "QuestGuard Updates": {
            "Look and Feel": "Planned very soon, there will be a slight redesign of certain elements on the website, and I will also put together a free book template, which will reflect the book version of the game, and which players will be able to use to homebrew any type of content! I am already working with a graphic designer for this, so fingers crossed!\nThere will also (finally) be an update to the mobile version of the website.\nI will also want to try out a hand-drawn version of the art on the website. Depending on whether some of the people in the community want to help or if we can make it look great, replacing AI art with human-made art is definitely something that's possible!\n",
            "Game Rules": "There are many things that still need work in QuestGuard as a game. Here are a few of the updates you should expect this year:\n- Level 9 Talents and Level 10 Ultimate Ability for all Classes\n- A complete set of Basic Abilities and Magic Items up to Level 10\n- Extra Feats and options for all Races and Classes\n- More monsters, aiming for 150 monsters by the release of the game\nAmong these, we can expect to finalize several rules of the game. There will be changes still! I can already foresee some rules and core systems that will probably be changed, but ultimately there will come a point where I believe the game is in a good enough state!\nSome things that I will want to experiment with are reworking Spell Grade, some extra roleplaying rules, trying out some different variants of Inspiration points, and more.\n",
            "Reworks": "You can expect several reworks of some more game elements. The first class on the list to be reworked is the Cleric.\nRaces such as the Bertles, Davels and Elves have a nice core idea, but I think they're not very well executed. Expect changes to multiple races.\nThe same goes for certain Classes and specializations.\nOf course, things may change. Feedback comes in all the time so let's see what happens!\n",
            "Other": "Expect also that many things be renamed, especially monsters and Abilities. Let's try to avoid copyright infringement!\n"
