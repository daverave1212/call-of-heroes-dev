    "Update 2023-12-31": {
        "Sum Up": [
            "This update is also quite a large one, focusing on reworking a core mechanic, removing/heavily reworking a class and bringing a lot of quality of life improvements to the game and even to the website (Desktop version)"
        ],
        "\u26a1 Reworked Paladin (Tentative)": "Even though the Paladin has been a popular class, I tend to believe it's so due to the class fantasy and certain interesting Abilities, without the core mechanics being very interesting.\nPaladins have been reworked from the ground up and have their own gimmick now: they no longer have Mana. Instead, they can cast any spell they have for free, once per turn, provided they haven't already cast it already.\nAside from that, Paladin specializations have been changed again to be more thematic and play into the class fantasy: Order of the Crusade, Order of the Tome and Order of the Templar, with Talents to double down on Paladin concepts, like being a Black or a White Knight, a Crusader, or even putting your faith on pause.\n",
        "\ud83d\udeaa Behind The Design (Paladin)": "Paladins had nothing truly interesting going on - they were simply a class with high stats, high damage and healing.\nThe Talents themselves were quite lackluster except for a few of them. Paladins also required a lot of tracking: tracking mana, tracking Holy Points, tracking Vengeance, etc.\nThis update had several goals for the Paladin: reduce number tracking, make them have an interaction with Basic Abilities and simplify Talent options with more Talent interactions with the core class Abilities and between eachother.\nOverall, even if it feels like Paladins lost some power and the new Faith Casting seems unusual, I believe these will make the Paladin stand out more rules-wise and be easier and more fun to play.\nIf after a while we realize that Faith Casting doesn't work and feel as planned, we'll go back to Mana.\n",
        "\ud83c\udff9 Reworked Hunter Core (Tentative)": "To make things more interesting, let's double down on this idea: Hunter now no longer has Mana either... at all.\nTo compensate, several Talents were made stronger, Hunters have normal Health / Level and gain +1 Stat every 3 Levels.\nHunters have also reaceived extra Talents that were previously missing.\n",
        "\ud83d\udeaa Behind The Design (Hunter)": "Hunters have always had an unusual power dynamic - the pet is free damage every turn, and can also act as a meat shield, and revived after every combat.\nThat make it so that Hunters had 0 Mana, low Health (which discouraged a more melee playstyle) and could not afford some more powerful Talents.\nRemoving Mana altogether from the Hunter means it can focus on what it does best and what is most fun, without having to trade off power in other areas.\n",
        "\ud83d\udc9a Reserve Health is now Health Regen (Tentative)": "After every Worthy combat, automatically heal for an amount equal to your Health Regen, up to 3 times per Adventure.\nHealth Regen is determined by your Race, plus your Level, plus your Might (e.g. 6 + Level, 5 + Level, etc).\nThis makes it much easier to calculate Health Regen (no more recalculating Reserve Health when increasing Max Health), balance Health Regen for some characters, requires less tracking and provides more interesting options.\nAs such, some Races have been rebalanced to be more interesting regarding Health Regen and Max Health.\nThis is a tentative change - if it doesn't work, we'll revert back to Reserve Health, but let's give it a try!\n",
        "\u270d\ud83c\udffc \"Replaces\" Keyword (Tentative)": "I changed the wording on several Abilities to make them easier to track on a sheet or a sheet of paper.\nSeveral Class Abilities now read as \"Replaces X\". Instead of getting a Passive new Ability that upgrades a different Ability, you get a new Ability altogether that replaces the old one.\nFor most of these, there is no functional change; it's exactly the same. It's just a wording difference.\nLet me know if you feel like this is more intuitive or not.\n",
        "\ud83d\udc32 Class Feats": "Some Classes now have Feats! Certain awkward Talents have been made into Feats instead.\nAs always, Feats allow for unique character builds and better customization, all while being completely optional! More is better!\nWe have Talents such as Lich Ritual (now available for Mages and Warlocks too), Old Ritual and Lycanthropy for Druids and Lone Wolf for Hunters. More to come\n",
        "\ud83d\udc89 Affliction Feats": "Added a new category for Feats called Afflictions. These are (at first glance at least) negative conditions for the character: missing an arm or a leg, being blind or deaf or having a chronic illness.\nI don't think anyone has played with these so far, but it's a good punishment from the GM in case they want to cut off a leg or two, or be affected by radiation poisoning in the eyes!\n",
        "\ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffc Humans Reworked": "Humans should naturally be the simplest Race to create and play (and the way they were, Humans were the most difficulty to create). As such, Humans have been greatly simplified.\n",
        "\ud83c\udf10 Cool new website updates!": [
            "You can now literally copy a spell and paste it in paint or any image editor. Try it! (as such, removed the Spell Sheet Maker page for now)",
            "Added a Magic Items page, for GM's only. _Notice some icons glow? Click on them and see what happens!_",
            "Added a Custom Ability Creator page! GM's and creators, have fun!",
            "Updated main page",
            "Reworked the Learn tab to now lead you to another more beautifully laid-out page",
            "Reworked the Rules page to have a glossary and be much better organized",
            "Added a Patch Notes page and the update version on the website (and changed logo)",
            "The default is now Simple Mode (no more background). People have complained a lot about slow website loading and this will probably help.",
            "Website should now scale better with non-mobile resolutions. There will be a mobile update some time in the future"
        ],
        "\ud83d\udcdc Other": [
            "Renamed a lot of Abilities for copyright reasons. More to come",
            "Removed the Conjuration Basic Ability List. Spells from it were moved to other fitting lists.",
            "Reworked the Divine Basic Ability List.",
            "Changed Charmed effect (again). A Charmed Unit can't move away from the Charmer or target it.",

    "QuestGuard 2024 Roadmap": {
        "Intro": "It's been almost 1 year since QuestGuard has been on its feet, and, of course, since we've all been together here; this game would never have made it so far without the wonderful community. I am forever grateful for all the friends I've made and for all the amazing people I've met, and here's to another year of awesome people and interesting campaigns!\nHere is what I am planning with QuestGuard in the coming year.\n",
        "Dave Campaigns": {
            "1. Starter Adventure": "In the first part of 2024, I will be working on a starter adventure mini-campaign that I will wrap nicely inside a booklet, which will be available either as a separate module or part of the core rulebook.\nI aim for a 4-6 session campaign that's easy to read and introduces all the rules of QuestGuard to new players, one by one, in an easy-to-understand fashion.\nI will most likely run this campaign once or twice, and then hopefully other people can help run it as well to get feedback!\n",
            "2. Ironborn Campaign (?)": "For the current players who took part in Nordheim, I'm planning another campaign or series of mini-campaigns aiming to continue the arcs established in Nordheim.\nThis would take place in the \"Outerworlds\" (placeholder name) where the Ironborn resides. There, the players' new characters will explore a strange and deadly realm and meet old heroes, such as likes of Loki, Flyxer and Ilda, and find out what they've been up to.\nThis is, of course, still heavily in planning; stay tuned, I'll let everyone know if and when this happens!\n"
        },
        "QuestGuard Updates": {
            "Look and Feel": "Planned very soon, there will be a slight redesign of certain elements on the website, and I will also put together a free book template, which will reflect the book version of the game, and which players will be able to use to homebrew any type of content! I am already working with a graphic designer for this, so fingers crossed!\nThere will also (finally) be an update to the mobile version of the website.\nI will also want to try out a hand-drawn version of the art on the website. Depending on whether some of the people in the community want to help or if we can make it look great, replacing AI art with human-made art is definitely something that's possible!\n",
            "Game Rules": "There are many things that still need work in QuestGuard as a game. Here are a few of the updates you should expect this year:\n- Level 9 Talents and Leevl 10 Ultimate Ability for all Classes\n- A complete set of Basic Abilities and Magic Items up to Level 10\n- Extra Feats and options for all Races and Classes\n- More monsters, aiming for 150 monsters by the release of the game\nAmong these, we can expect to finalize several rules of the game. There will be changes still! I can already foresee some rules and core systems that will probably be changed, but ultimately there will come a point where I believe the game is in a good enough state!\nSome things that I will want to experiment with are reworking Spell Grade, some extra roleplaying rules, trying out some different variants of Inspiration points, and more.\n",
            "Reworks": "You can expect several reworks of some more game elements. The first class on the list to be reworked is the Cleric.\nRaces such as the Bertles, Davels and Elves have a nice core idea, but I think they're not very well executed. Expect changes to multiple races.\nThe same goes for certain Classes and specializations.\nOf course, things may change. Feedback comes in all the time so let's see what happens!\n",
            "Other": "Expect also that many things be renamed, especially monsters and Abilities. Let's try to avoid copyright infringement!\n"

            "Feats reimagined - Feat Points don't exist anymore. Instead, every character can freely get as many Feats as they want, up to 1 every 2 Levels. However, each individual Feat now has a cost (like Multiclassing Feats). This way, you can balance out your character, and also not feel like you're missing out if you don't get want any Feat. It will also make the game easier to parse for new players, while giving more options to veterans.",
            "Main Stat removed - Main Stat is just a word for \"Intelligence or Sense or Charisma, whichever is higher.\" While it's nice to have this generic word for it, I think the game will be easier to parse without it. Some abilities stayed the same but have different wording, some now use directly a specific Stat. It will also incentivise different stat builds. Some Abilities _changed_ but are not listed because they now display \"your highest Stat\" instead of \"Main Stat\" or were just reworded.",
