{
    "Before Adventuring": "You have not started adventuring yet. Your skills are basic, with very little combat experience, so your abilities aren't honed.\nYou don't have a clear combat style either, for that requires some experience, which you are bound to gain in time.\n",
    "Level 1": "At Level 1 you figure out what works for you, and devote yourself to a specific specialization.\nThis happens either through practice, vows, learning or just being granted that power by a god or other being.\nYou now have a good understanding of your practice, yet you still lack a lot in power.\nYou are at the very beginning of your adventures.\nRight now you might be frail and unexperienced, but a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.\nEven a goblin or a giant rat poses a challenge to you.\n",
    "Level 2": "At Level 2, some time has passed, and you have learned and experienced things.\nDue to your adventuring, you managed to improve your combat art through sheer practice and experience.\nYou are one step ahead of a goblin. Better prepared, stronger and with a clearer purpose.\nYou might even be able to take out a trained guard all by yourself.\n",
    "Level 3": "Level 3 is a middle ground.\nAlthough it might not seem like much, it is a noticeable improvement.\nDefeating foes, climbing mountains and achieving complex feats has lead to an increase in your overall resistance.\nYou are able to endure more, and your improved focus on your goal has lead to better use of your combat skills.\nAdventuring is probably already in your blood and soul, and the next step is a hard one to achieve (but not impossible).\nYou are probably confident that you can take on a hired soldier or mercenary, but those are ordinary people...\nThe real challenge is the beasts that await you on your journeys...\n",
    "Level 4": "There is a long and ardous journey to Level 4.\nYour knowledge of the world has given you better awareness, which allows you to see and take oportunities to strike your foes you would not normally have seen.\nThis level is what separates regular adventurers from the ones who are willing to go all in, head first, and risk their lives to achieve greatness.\nWith caution and a good party, you can probably clear out dungeons people are afraid to go in.\nThe corpse at the entrance of a dungeon will not be yours.\n",
    "Level 5": "At Level 5 you walk with your trophies. You have conquered dungeons and defeated unspeakable enemies.\nIf you are a spellcaster, it is bound that you have found some ancient tome or accessed stronger powers through studying and self development, therefore allowing you to cast more powerful spells.\nYou are preparing to become a Hero.\nYou are among powerful knights, master level mages or experienced assassins.\nDo you have what it takes to be better than them?\nIf your heart says yes, then carry on. More greatness is yet to come.\n",
    "Level 6": "At Level 6 you are an elite member in your domain.\nIt is this type of adventurers who are ready to travel accross lands and be recruited for peculiar jobs.\nOne can hire an army and send it to its death.\nBut don't compare yourself to an army. You are alone a force to be reckoned with, and your life has better purpose than that.\nIt is the call of adventure for a Hero who can save that precious something and knows the means to deal with less common problems.\nYou are confident in your abilities, and why shouldn't you be?\nTo take out ogre lords or master vampires is a great feat.\n",
    "Level 7": "At Level 7 you are progressing as more than an adventurer.\nYour achievements have shaped you into who you are.\nLords and greater threats might seek your council.\nYou have achieved so much, yet, what does it take to be considered the Hero?\nAre you ready to venture into deadly places people have never been to?\nAre you ready to traverse the plains in search of your purpose?\nTo aid those in desperate need?\nTo slay those who need slaying?\nHow much are you willing to do to be called a Hero?\n",
    "Level 8": "At Level 8, there is no doubt about your skills.\nYou are an archmage or grand druid, a highly elite veteran of war or a revered cleric.\nNever forget your upbringing. You are a mortal. Death is real.\nNothing is impossible, you can achieve that which you wish to achieve, even if others might deem it impossible.\nYou ask yourself, what is money worth?\nWhat could you still possibly want? What motivates you?\nExploring new lands? A personal quest? Conquering the unconquerable?\nWhat stands in your way? Giants? Dragons? Or perhaps other people as strong as you, seeking your anihilation.\n",
    "Level 9": "Level 9 is approaching the pinnacle of your grand powers.\nYou seek immortality or gods. You seek to change the world around you, for good.\nYou seek to leave your mark into this world through your feats.\nYou only get to live one life. Live it well.\nOr perhaps, more lives are exactly what you wish to achieve.\n",
    "Level 10": "What is a Hero, truly? Are you one?\nWhat matters the most is what you believe yourself to be.\nYou are who you are in your own eyes, and perhaps somebody else in the eyes of others.\nYour hard work may yet be done. You have achieved the greatest feats a person can achieve, the greatest power.\nYou can't change who you are. Be yourself. Do as you will.\nDo not be fooled by life.\nYou are frail , a small dot in a huge, unknowable universe.\nAs easily as you were born you might just... vanish, be stomped on by greater cosmic powers.\nWe strive to achieve infinity, but infinity will always be greater than us.\nBe proud of your achievements. Call yourself a Hero.\nWhatever happens, know that you will be remembered, in life and in death!\nThis is Level 10.\n"
