    "Where to find monsters": "All monsters are found at GM Resources > Monsters.\nBefore continuing to read this section, take a look at some Monsters to get used to the monster stat block.\nMost numbers you see are self-explanatory, but all other things are explained below.\n",
    "How to play monsters": "Monsters function similarly to players, but with a few simple changed rules:\n1. Monsters have fixed initiative and don't roll for initiative (and their initiative is unaffected by Dexterity or Charisma; the number you see at Initiative is what you get).\nSome monsters have different Initiative if they start as Ranged attackers vs if they start as Melee attackers.\n2. Monsters don't have Half-Actions and Mana\nEach turn, a monster can choose one of its Abilities (the white blocks with a RED line on top).\nIf an Ability says it's free, then it takes no Action (0 Actions) (e.g. Naga Mage - Enslave Magic can be cast by each Naga Mage once per combat, for free, without using an Action).\nIf an Ability says (x2) or (x3), then the monster makes that many attacks with that Ability (e.g. Kobolds 1H Weapon). So, if a monster decides to use that Ability, if it says (x2), then it will use that Ability TWICE. For our Kobolds, their 1H Weapon Ability has an (x2) noted and it deals 1d6 + 2 damage, so all Kobolds make 2 attacks, each of which deals 1d6 + 2.\n",
    "$Monster Passives": "Each monster might have some Passive Abilities (white blocks with a BLUE line on top).\n",
    "$Monster suggestions": "On the right side of the monster page, there are some simple suggestions for how to play monsters of that type (e.g. \"Kobolds run away after they finish attacking\", or \"Each Stonemantle flies and targets one enemy\").\nThere are also suggestions on what obstacles to add to the fight, what other monsters to add to the encounter, and there might also be some ideas for interesting ways to use the monsters.\n",
    "$Playing monsters fairly": "Monsters should generally try to distribute their attacks and damage among the players.\nIt doesn't feel fair if all the monsters to attack a single player and kill them in the first round of combat. Try to have monsters attack different targets.\n",
    "Encounter XP": "Building a combat encounter for your players is very simple!\nEach team of Players or Monsters has a certain Encounter Budget. Each Player has an Encounter Budget and the total Encounter Budget of the party is the sum of all players' Encounter Budgets.\nSame for monsters. The total Encounter Budget of a group of monsters is equal to the sum of each monster's Encounter Budget.\nA Level 1 Player has an Encounter Budget of 100 XP.\nWhen building an encounter, the idea is to have the Player Encounter Budget be equal to the Monster Encounter Budget for a standard, medium difficulty encounter.\n",
    "$1. Calculate the Encounter Budget for the players": "Each Player's Experience Budget is 100 XP at Level 1, 125 XP at Level 2, 150 XP at Level 3 and so on (25 extra XP for each Level).\nSo, if you have 4 Players of Level 1, that's 4 x 100 XP, so 400 Experience Budget for a party of 4 Players of Level 1.\n",
    "$2. Calculate the Encounter Budget for the monsters": "Each monster has a different Encounter Budget. For example, a Wolf has 75 XP, but a Gnoll has 150 XP. A Fairy Dragon has 500 XP.\nYou must mix and match monsters so their total Encounter Budget is somewhat equal to the players' total Encounter Budget.\nFor a party of 4 Players of Level 1, 4 Bat Swarms is exactly a medium difficulty encounter (100 XP * 4). 5 Wolves (75 XP * 5) is also a somewhat medium encounter for our player group (375 XP for the wolves).\n",
    "$Encounter Budget for many monsters (important)": "The more monsters you add to an encounter (respecting the Encounter Budgets), the EASIER it is.\nFor example, let's compare two different encounters: 4 Kobolds (4 * 100 XP = 400 XP) and 8 Hounds (8 * 50 = 400 XP). These two encounters have the exact same Budget.\nHowever, the 8 Hounds encounter is easier, because of several reasons:\n1. Players have Area Abilities, and can kill multiple Hounds at the same time.\n2. It's easier to kill each Hound one by one (e.g. even if 2 Hounds are as strong as 1 Kobold, if one Hound dies from 10 damage, then 1 Hound remains and it's weaker than 1 Kobold; on the other hand, 1 Kobold doesn't die from 10 damage).\nTo balance this, subtract 5% from the Encounter Budget for each extra monster more than the number of players. So, if we have 4 Players and 8 Hounds, that is 4 extra Hounds compared to the players. 4 * 5% = 20%. So we subtract 20% from our 400 XP hounds (20% 400 XP = 80 XP) and we find out that the true Encounter Budget of our Hounds encounter is actually worth only 320 XP. 320 XP is an Easy-Medium encounter for the players.\nYou should not subtract more than 50% from the Encounter Budget.\n",
    "$Monster Degree": "Monsters are either Normal monsters or Epic monsters (bosses).\nNormal monsters are normal.\nEpic monsters take MULTIPLE turns, one after another, depending on their Degree.\nFor example, an Ogre has a Degree of 2. That literally means an Ogre will take 2 turns in a row (e.g. moves and takes an action, then starts its next turn and can move and take an action again).\n",
    "Epic Monsters": "Epic monsters take MULTIPLE turns, one after another, depending on their Degree.\nFor example, an Ogre has a Degree of 2. That literally means an Ogre will take 2 turns in a row (e.g. moves and takes an action, then starts its next turn and can move and take an action again).\nAlso, an Epic monster must alternate its Abilities (non-passives). If it has 3 Abilities, it can't choose to use only one of them all the time. It must use the first Ability on one turn, then the 2nd Ability next turn, an then the 3rd Ability on its next turn. Then it can use the 1st Ability again on the next turn, and so on.\nIt is up to the GM to choose the order of the Abilities.\nIf the Epic monster can't use an Ability, it will not use it. If it has no other Abilities to use, and can't use that Ability or it makes no sense to use that Ability, it will just not do an Action.\n",
    "$Monster Degree Note": "Note that Crowd Control lasts for 1 turn. If your monster has a Degree of 2, it takes 2 TURNS, one after another. The Crowd Control only lasts for ONE turn, so it applies to its first turn only, NOT to both (if its lasts normally for 1 turn).\nAlso, if the Epic monster has a Crowd Control on it (e.g. is Stunned), and another player adds another Crowd Control (e.g. another Stun), the second Stun does NOT go on the monster's second turn. All the Crowd Control from the players is applied to the monster's first turn only.\n",
    "Homebrewing Monsters": "The best way to make a homebrew monster is to take the stat block of an official existing monster, keep its Health, Defense and XP (or slightly change them) and give it different Stats, Abilities, Passives, etc.\nWhen you make custom Abilities for your monster, do check out the Abilities of other similar monsters to see how powerful they should be.\n",
    "Homebrewing Philosophy": "When making a homebrew monster, apply the following suggestions:\n- Crowd Control should require a Check (e.g. don't make an Ability that just outright Snares or Silences the player)\n- Avoid Stuns, Paralyses, Sleep etc. It's not fun for a player to skip its turn.\n- Do give your monster Silence, Daze, Maim, Slow, Charm, Fear or Blind Abilities. These will make your players alter their playstyle.\n- Do give your monster 50% Resistance to certain damage types (within reason). These will also make your players alter their playstyle.\n- Avoid giving Epic Monsters extra bonuses to Combat Checks; Stat bonuses should be enough, plus they take multiple turns.\n- Avoid giving Epic Monsters \"Epic Resistances\" (e.g. \"if it fails a Combat Check, it can choose to pass it instead\"). This is a special thing some monsters have in other games, but Call of Heroes does not endorse this type of Ability.\n- Avoid \"Pass or Die\" Abilities (e.g. avoid giving your monsters Abilities that do huge amounts of Damage if the player fails the Check, or Abilities that do huge damage directly).\n- Avoid crazy dice swings (e.g. avoid giving monsters attacks that can wildly swing between very little damage or a lot of damage). For example, avoid giving your monster an attack that deals 2d12 Damage, because that is at minimum 2 Damage and at maximum 24 Damage, but the average is 13 damage. If you want to deal 13 damage, a more fair roll would be 2d8 + 4, or 2d6 + 6, or 4d4 + 3, for example.\n- Do be inventive and create! Give your monsters certain small gimmicks! Monsters in Call of Heroes aren't just stat blocks. Players should adjust their strategy to defeat every different monster!"
